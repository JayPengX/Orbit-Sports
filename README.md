# 四方賽程 Quadra Fixtures (Match Find)

**Tell you what's actually worth watching today — Premier League, MLB, NBA, and F1 — in your own local time, scored by real data, not guesswork.**

## Quadra 四方

This app is part of **Quadra 四方**, four apps sharing one account:

| App | Was | Part it plays |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **四方證券 Quadra Securities** | Stock Study 股市研究室 | The base: a play-money brokerage where the money lives and grows |
| **四方運彩 Quadra Sportsbook** | Odds Study 賠率研究室 | A side play: sports lottery odds and betting |
| **四方賽程 Quadra Fixtures** | Match Find | A schedule tool: what's worth watching |
| **四方單字 Quadra Words** | Orbit Vocab 英單力 | A big mini game with real benefit: English words that pay |

- **The Quadra Pass 四方通行碼**: one 10-character code for all four apps and
  every device (Shared-Proxy's `/eco` route). Passes are the only kind of
  code; an old app-only code is upgraded to one the next time its app opens.
- **One money pool**: Securities' NT$ cash and Sportsbook's balance are the
  same money. Sportsbook's bets and winnings, Words' study rewards and
  transfers between passes all land in it, with records on every side.
- **The economy**: every account opens with NT$100,000 in Securities, which
  pays NT$3,000 on the 1st of each month; Sportsbook adds NT$10,000 once and
  NT$1,000 each week; both only when that app is opened. Words pays NT$2 a
  right answer and NT$20 a newly mastered word (NT$800 a day at most);
  Securities' and Sportsbook's mini games pay for skill, up to NT$1,000 and
  NT$1,500 a day. Sportsbook has a weekly betting limit you can set.
- **One pass, signed in everywhere**: the same Quadra Pass panel in all four
  apps; links between the apps carry the pass (in the address's #hash), so
  the app they open is already signed in, even in the iPhone pop-up browser.
  An old one-app code turns into a pass by itself.
- **Installed only** on phones and tablets (added to the home screen), and
  every app checks for a new deploy on opening, on coming back and every
  five minutes, clearing old cached files before it reloads.
- `quadra.mjs` and `quadra.css` are the same file in all four apps; the
  icons and link cards come from Shared-Proxy's `brand/generate.mjs`.

## Overview

Match Find is a small static site, with a UI available in both Traditional
Chinese and English (auto-detected from your browser - see [English](#english)
above), that answers
one question: **what's actually worth watching today**, across the Premier
League, MLB, NBA, and F1. It shows fixtures in the viewer's own local time,
with team logos, home/away labels, bilingual (English / Traditional
Chinese) team names and venues, where to watch each fixture in Taiwan
(愛爾達體育台, Apple TV, ...), a horizontally-scrolling day picker (today
through the next two weeks, auto-jumping past today once today's fixtures
are already over), and a curated daily lineup picked so a viewer can watch
back-to-back without constant channel-hopping or being told to stay up for
a 3am kickoff. The page itself only ever shows the *recommendation* — a
plain-language reason, not the raw competitiveness/watchability numbers
behind it (see [Page Layout & UI](#page-layout--ui)).

There is no sign-up and no app. It's a static GitHub Pages site, deployed
only when its own code changes, and installable as a PWA. The match list
is built by one shared pipeline (`buildMatches`) that runs in two places:
every 5 minutes in a GitHub Action, which publishes the result as a
prebuilt snapshot, and in the viewer's own browser as the fallback. The
page normally reads the snapshot on open and on its refresh timers, and
live games are polled every 30 seconds on top (see [Live Match Data &
Refresh](#live-match-data--refresh) and [Load
Performance](#load-performance)). Keeping each viewer off the proxy for
everything except live games is what keeps the shared Cloudflare Worker
inside its free daily quota (see [Cloudflare Quota](#cloudflare-quota)).
There is also no in-page header: an
earlier version had a slim one, but it was dropped entirely, since an
installed PWA's home-screen icon and OS title bar already carry the app's
identity, and a masthead here was just empty space repeating that. Settings
(⚙) lives inline with the sport filter chips instead.

## Key Features

- **Cross-sport daily digest** — Premier League, MLB, NBA, and F1 (including
  qualifying and sprint sessions) in one place, in the viewer's own local
  time zone.
- **A real scheduling plan, not just a ranked list** — "recommended
  fixtures" is a back-to-back-watchable plan for the day, not a set of
  independent "this one's good" judgments (see [The Viewing Plan
  Algorithm](#the-viewing-plan-algorithm)).
- **Fully deterministic scoring** — every fixture's score comes from real,
  current sports-data APIs (MLB Stats API, Jolpica F1 API, ESPN standings),
  computed by a transparent formula. No AI is involved anywhere in this
  pipeline (see [The Deterministic Scoring Engine](#the-deterministic-scoring-engine)).
- **Bilingual presentation** — English/Traditional Chinese team names and
  venues, with a best-effort translation table for teams (see [Fixing a
  Team's Chinese Name](#fixing-a-teams-chinese-name)).
- **Taiwan broadcast info** — a deterministic rule resolves where to watch
  each fixture in Taiwan, with small color-coded service badges (see
  [Broadcast Service Registry](#broadcast-service-registry)).
- **Live win% odds** — sourced from Polymarket, devigged, shown per fixture
  where a real market exists, including F1 outright and pole-position
  markets, with ESPN's sportsbook moneyline as a pre-game fallback and a
  small source label under the bar (see [Live Win% Odds](#live-win-odds)).
- **Live in-progress detail** — a sport-specific live status widget
  (baseball diamond with runners/outs, NBA/EPL clock, F1 flags and running
  order) on any card that is currently live (see [Live Score/Odds
  Polling](#live-scoreodds-polling)).
- **Touch-driven swipeable card stack** for genuinely conflicting fixtures,
  built on raw Touch Events rather than native scroll-snap for
  cross-device/cross-browser reliability (see [The Swipeable Card
  Stack](#the-swipeable-card-stack)).
- **Local-only preferences** — sport priority, enabled sports, and pinned
  ("Prefer") choices all live in this browser's own `localStorage`; there
  is no account and no cross-device sync (see [Local-Only Data &
  Privacy](#local-only-data--privacy)).
- **Fast first screen** — a prebuilt match-list snapshot paints the page
  from one small request, and a service worker keeps the site's own code
  on the device so the home-screen app starts without waiting on the
  network (see [Load Performance](#load-performance)).
- **PWA-installable**, with a service worker for the app's own code only
  (never match data) — a new deploy is still detected and applied in
  place, never silently left stale (see [Version Detection & Manual
  Refresh](#version-detection--manual-refresh)).

## How It Works

Scoring and picking are split across two different concerns, deliberately:

1. **Fetch.** `public/lib/match-builder.mjs`'s `buildMatches`, called
   directly by the viewer's own browser (through the shared proxy — see
   [The Shared Proxy Architecture](#the-shared-proxy-architecture); also
   callable from Node via `scripts/build-data.mjs`, kept only for local
   dev/debugging tooling), fetches upcoming *and currently-live* fixtures
   for the next 14 days from [ESPN's public scoreboard
   API](https://site.api.espn.com) — no API key needed for this part. Only
   a **finished** fixture is excluded; every refresh re-fetches ESPN's live
   feed, so a fixture that was still upcoming last refresh has very often
   already started by the next one. Dropping a fixture the moment ESPN
   flips it to "live" used to mean a match a viewer was actively watching
   would simply vanish from "today" mid-game, even though the client
   already had everything it needed (`relativeLabel`/`.is-live`, see [Page
   Layout & UI](#page-layout--ui)) to show it as 直播中 once it was actually
   in the data — so live fixtures stay in. Each fixture comes with both
   teams' ESPN-hosted logo and a Traditional Chinese name looked up from
   `public/lib/team-names.mjs` (a static, best-effort translation table —
   a team missing from it just shows English-only).
2. **Score.** `public/lib/objective-score.mjs` and
   `public/lib/sport-signals.mjs` compute **competitiveness**,
   **watchability**, **enduranceScore**, and **broadcastQuality** for every
   fixture deterministically, from real, current sports-data APIs — this is
   the *whole* score, not a baseline something else refines. There is no AI
   anywhere in this step (see [The Deterministic Scoring
   Engine](#the-deterministic-scoring-engine) for the full history of why
   AI was removed, and for the one small, bounded, and since-removed
   exception that briefly existed one layer up, at the recommendation-plan
   level). MLB pulls standings/recent-form/streak data from the official
   MLB Stats API; F1 pulls the championship-standings gap from the
   Ergast-compatible Jolpica API; every sport folds in season record and
   real market odds (Polymarket — see [Live Win% Odds](#live-win-odds)),
   already fetched, plus the same rivalry/derby/national-broadcast
   detectors `public/lib/sport-duration.mjs` uses for duration. This is
   computed on every refresh, for every fixture.
3. **Return.** The result — every fixture, scored, nothing filtered or
   picked yet — is what `buildMatches` returns, straight back to the
   caller. There is no intermediate file for the deployed site;
   `scripts/build-data.mjs` can still write one to
   `public/data/matches.json` for local dev tooling (see [Getting
   Started](#getting-started)).
4. **Plan.** `public/app.js`'s `resolveViewingPlan`, still running in the
   viewer's own browser, converts every fixture's kickoff to the viewer's
   own local time and applies their Settings nudges (sport priority, owned
   services). The actual "what's worth watching today" decision — **one
   local calendar day at a time**, because "what counts as an unreasonable
   hour" and "which fixtures actually conflict" are both relative to the
   viewer's own clock — happens in `computeDayPlan`, described in full in
   [The Viewing Plan Algorithm](#the-viewing-plan-algorithm).

## The Deterministic Scoring Engine

Every fixture's score is exactly what `public/lib/objective-score.mjs`
computes from real, current statistical signals
`public/lib/sport-signals.mjs` fetches. There is no AI involved anywhere in
this step, and there has not been for most of this project's history. The
one blend of scores that ever gets shown or scheduled from is
`bestMatchScore` (`public/lib/recommendation.mjs`); an earlier version let
viewers pick between two subtly different "recommendation styles," but that
choice added confusion without adding real value, so there is now only ever
one recommendation system.

### Per-sport signals

- **MLB** ([MLB Stats API](https://statsapi.mlb.com), free, no key):
  division/wild-card standings proximity (`gamesBack` /
  `wildCardGamesBack` — how alive each team's own playoff race is right
  now), each team's own last-10-games record and current win/loss streak,
  plus season record and betting odds already fetched from ESPN. Team pace
  offsets and the Coors Field modifier from the duration model (see
  [Duration & Broadcast-Source Resolution](#duration--broadcast-source-resolution))
  are deliberately *not* reused here — a fast/slow-pace team says nothing
  about how close a given matchup actually is.
- **F1** ([Ergast-compatible Jolpica API](https://api.jolpi.ca), the
  community-run successor to the original Ergast API which shut down at
  the end of the 2024 season; also free, no key): the current drivers'
  championship standings gap between P1 and P2, turned into a 0
  (mathematically decided) to 1 (a dead heat) title-race intensity that
  feeds *every* race that season's watchability — a title fight still very
  much alive makes every remaining race more consequential, independent of
  which circuit it's at.
- **NBA** (ESPN's own `/apis/v2/sports/basketball/nba/standings` — same
  host/team-naming as the scoreboard fetch, so no separate id-mapping table
  is needed): each team's own signed distance to its conference's real seed
  cutoffs (`sixSeedGap` / `tenSeedGap` — the direct-playoff line and the
  play-in line, the same "either race keeps it alive" reasoning as MLB's
  division/wild-card pair), last-10-games record, and current streak — the
  same depth MLB's own standings integration has, not a shallower stand-in.
  This is guarded against a real failure mode caught live: every team reads
  0-0 before a season actually starts (preseason exhibitions), which would
  otherwise report a maxed-out "playoff race" for every single game. See
  `parseNbaStandingsResponse`'s own `seasonStarted` check.
- **Premier League** (ESPN's own `/apis/v2/sports/soccer/eng.1/standings`):
  each team's own signed *points* gap to the real Champions League
  qualification line (top 4) and the relegation line (bottom 3 of 20) — a
  genuine stakes signal EPL never had before, on top of season record and
  betting odds already fetched from ESPN, and the same rivalry/derby and
  national-broadcast detectors `public/lib/sport-duration.mjs` already
  computes for the duration model (`isNbaRivalry` / `isEplDerby` /
  `isNationalBroadcast`). EPL specifically has no recent-form signal — see
  [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) — because ESPN's own standings
  response for this league has no per-team streak/last-5 figure at all.

### Market win% (Polymarket), replacing the odds spread when it's liquid

MLB/NBA/Premier League's own `competitiveness` used to blend season record,
recent form, and ESPN's own betting-market spread (`closenessFromSpread`).
Polymarket's own devigged moneyline win% (`public/lib/polymarket.mjs` —
already fetched for the on-card odds badge, see [Live Win%
Odds](#live-win-odds)) now feeds the same slot too, via
`closenessFromWinProb`, whenever a fixture's market is actually liquid — a
real trade price needs no spread-to-closeness heuristic the way a
sportsbook line does, and for Premier League specifically it's usually the
*only* market-based closeness signal there is at all, since ESPN
essentially never posts a real spread for EPL fixtures.

This **replaces** the spread-based signal rather than blending with it —
both measure the exact same underlying thing (how lopsided this fixture is
expected to be), and stacking them would just double-count one real signal
as two. The market price wins whenever it's genuinely there; the odds
spread survives purely as the fallback for the (common) case of a fixture
more than roughly a day and a half out, before Polymarket has real depth.

**Liquidity gating.** A live snapshot of every real MLB moneyline market
open on 2026-09-23 (232 combined-market events across the remaining
season) showed liquidity tracks how soon the game is, not a flat number:
inside ~21 hours of first pitch, markets were already deeply liquid
($14k–$730k); 1.5–3 days out, still real trading ($4k–$12k); past ~3.5
days out, liquidity fell off a cliff to $76–$400 — a market that exists
(Polymarket lists it the moment the schedule is known) but that nothing
has actually traded on yet, same as an empty order book with a stale last
price. `POLYMARKET_MIN_LIQUIDITY_FOR_SCORING` (2000, in
`public/lib/polymarket.mjs`) sits in the real gap between those two tiers.
A fixture whose market hasn't cleared it yet keeps
`oddsMarketWinPctAway`/`oddsMarketWinPctHome` null and falls back to the
odds spread — the on-card win% badge itself is unaffected either way and
still shows whatever price exists, thin or not, same as a real trader
would see; only the SCORE is gated. `WINPROB_LOPSIDED_GAP_AT` (70
percentage points, `public/lib/objective-score.mjs`), the point past which
a market win% gap bottoms out `competitiveness` the same way a maxed-out
spread already did, is calibrated the same way — the 232-market sample's
own real pregame gap distribution (median 22pp, p99 66pp, max 73pp) rarely
gets more lopsided than that for a single MLB game, since even a clear
favorite is bounded by starting-pitcher variance.

**Scope limit, not an oversight:** this only ever feeds scoring on a build
that awaits Polymarket enrichment BEFORE scoring runs (`buildMatches`'
main path, which `scripts/build-data.mjs` and `dump-day-plan.mjs` already
use) — the live in-browser refresh (`public/app.js`) still fetches
Polymarket odds as an unblocked, non-blocking fast-follow *after* the
score has already painted, exactly as before, and does not retroactively
rescore once it lands. A viewer's live session keeps that day's
spread-based closeness for the rest of the session; the next full rebuild
or page reload picks up the market upgrade. Deliberate: the closeness
component this replaces is already a small slice (≤30%) of a small slice
(10%) of the overall `bestMatchScore`, not worth re-running the
per-sport standings-context plumbing client-side on every background odds
tick for.

### Why AI was removed from scoring

`competitiveness`/`watchability`/`enduranceScore`/`broadcastQuality` used
to be asked from Gemini directly, essentially "from memory," then, for one
intermediate period, computed deterministically first with Gemini
validating the result. Gemini is gone entirely from this step now — every
fixture's score is exactly what `computeMatchObjectiveScore` computes from
real, current, statistically-grounded signals, not the old crude
win-rate-only `heuristicScore` from before this engine existed (long
since removed).

Two independent reasons killed the Gemini-validation step, not one:

1. **Free-tier quota couldn't sustain the workload.** Google Search
   grounding — the one thing that could have added real signal a formula
   can't see, like an injury — failed with a `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` quota
   error on 100% of live-tested requests. This was a billing-tier wall, not
   a bug.
2. **Even the plain validation call, when it succeeded, was structurally
   bounded to a ±2 nudge per dimension.** A live-verified case (a 0-0
   preseason exhibition scoring near-maximum competitiveness) showed Gemini
   correctly *identifying* the problem in its own reasoning text while
   being unable to fix it, because only the deterministic formula itself
   could move the score that far.

The reason text shown on each card (`buildObjectiveReasonZh`) is built from
the actual factors behind the score (e.g. "依雙方戰績、近期戰況、盤口數據
計算。"), not an AI-generated sentence.

A second, narrower AI experiment happened later, at the recommendation-plan
level rather than in per-fixture scoring, and was also ultimately removed
in full — see [The Gemini Tie-Break: A Removed
Experiment](#the-gemini-tie-break-a-removed-experiment) under [Live Match
Data & Refresh](#live-match-data--refresh). As of today, this engine has no
AI involvement anywhere, for the second time in this project's history.

### The `bestMatchScore` blend

**Full rewrite** (direct instruction, replacing everything below through
2026-09-23): rank the way a TV network producer would — "what would the
most people actually tune into" — not "which game is the tensest
nail-biter." The previous model blended five fields together and then
bolted a separate, undiluted "marquee fixture" bonus on top just to give a
famous team enough real weight to matter — a patch that, once MLB gained a
second stackable name-based bonus (`isBigClub`, alongside the existing
rivalry bonus), could blank a genuinely competitive small-market race out
of the recommended lineup for a week straight any time literally any
bigger name played that day, because the patch's own flat `+2` dwarfed the
`0.6`-point gap the whole-week variety-rotation mechanism needs to treat
two matchups as real rivals (see [Games that already happened can't
reshape a series](#games-that-already-happened-cant-reshape-a-series)).
Live case: Milwaukee Brewers @ Philadelphia Phillies — a real, competitive
playoff race with no fame signal at all — lost every single day from
9/22–9/27 to whatever other MLB game happened to involve a bigger-market
team, even to a merely-present Chicago Cubs game against a mediocre Miami
Marlins side.

The target is "the best game of the day — what TV thinks the most people
will watch", so Fame carries 55% (raised from 40%, Quality lowered from
30% to 15%): team quality mostly already shows up in fame and stakes, and
at 30% it let two good-but-obscure teams outrank the game the networks
actually put on air.

`bestMatchScore` is now a weighted blend of four axes
(`BEST_MATCH_WEIGHTS` in `public/lib/recommendation.mjs`), each still
computed from real data — no vibes, no AI:

| Axis | Weight | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| `watchability` (**Fame**) | 0.55 | Is this a mainstream draw on name recognition alone — a historic rivalry, a big-market/marquee franchise, national broadcast placement? |
| `skill` (**Quality**) | 0.15 | How *good* are the two teams actually, independent of tonight's pairing |
| `stakes` (**Stakes**) | 0.2 | How much does this game matter for the season/championship race right now |
| `competitiveness` (**Closeness**) | 0.1 | How close is tonight's specific score expected to be |

Renormalized over whichever of the four a fixture actually has — a
finished/never-scored match, or a sport missing one signal (F1 has no
`skill`), still gets a real number built from what *is* known. Falls back
to the build-time composite `match.score` only when none of the four are
set at all. The one place a viewer's own taste actually overrides the
algorithm is **Prefer** — swiping a card stack to commit to a specific
alternative (see [Pinning: "Prefer"](#pinning-prefer)) — which is local,
explicit, and per-match, not a blanket ranking toggle.

#### `skill` (Quality)

`skillFromWinPct` (`public/lib/objective-score.mjs`) is deliberately a
separate axis from `competitiveness`: two elite teams playing a close game
and two also-ran teams playing an equally close game score identically on
closeness alone, but they're not the same recommendation. NBA and EPL feed
it the two teams' *average* win%/points-rate. MLB instead feeds it the
*better* team's own win% (`Math.max(awayWinPct, homeWinPct)`) — an average
cancels out exactly the case this axis exists for: a 96-60 elite Dodgers
team against a 64-92 Giants team averages to roughly .51 (a neutral
skill≈5, indistinguishable from two genuinely mediocre .500-ish teams),
while the better-team's-own-win% version correctly reads that pairing as
containing a genuinely elite team. `skill` is null for F1 (no
per-competitor quality signal exists for a single-driver race) and
renormalized away like any other missing signal.

#### `stakes` (Stakes)

How much a fixture matters for the season/championship race right now —
MLB's playoff/wild-card proximity (`playoffProximityScore`, preferring the
MLB Stats API's own `magicNumber` when a division leader hasn't clinched
yet — see below), NBA's play-in/playoff seed-cutoff proximity
(`cutoffProximityScore`), EPL's Champions League/relegation table-position
proximity, each maxed at 10 for a genuine postseason game (MLB/NBA). F1 has
no separate stakes signal — the championship-race intensity that already
drives its `competitiveness`/`watchability` *is* the stakes. This used to
be computed and then discarded straight into `watchability`'s own internal
blend; it's now returned and used on its own, at its own weight, in the
top-level ranking.

#### `watchability` (Fame)

A clean, **unblended** read of "is this a mainstream draw" — never mixed
with `skill`/`stakes`/momentum, and never gated by or capped against
`competitiveness` the way it used to be. Neutral baseline 5; a historic
rivalry and a big-market/marquee franchise each add their own full,
undiscounted lift and stack when a fixture is genuinely both (a Yankees @
Red Sox game draws more than either fact alone):

- **MLB**: `+2` known historic rivalry (`MLB_RIVALRY_PAIRS`), `+2`
  marquee franchise (`MLB_BIG_CLUBS` — Yankees, Dodgers, Red Sox, Cubs,
  Giants, Cardinals, Braves, Mets; either side alone qualifies), `+1`
  national broadcast (`isNationalBroadcast`, `MLB_NATIONAL_BROADCAST_NETWORKS`
  — see below).
- **NBA**: `+1.5` known rivalry, `+1` national broadcast
  (`isNationalBroadcast`).
- **EPL**: `+2` known derby (`isEplDerby`), `+2` big club
  (`EPL_BIG_CLUBS`, England's "Big Six").

Removing the old competitiveness-gated credit ramp and the per-sport
excess-damping ceilings this section used to document (all of them existed
purely to stop a famous name from dragging a decided blowout's rating too
far above how close tonight's score was — which only mattered because
closeness used to be the dominant signal watchability was measured
against) is safe precisely *because* closeness is now just a 10% factor in
the overall ranking, not the yardstick fame has to be protected from
overriding: a fame-less but genuinely elite, high-stakes team can still
outrank a merely-present big name through `skill`/`stakes`'s own real,
separate weight, without needing a gate inside `watchability` itself.

**The Dodgers/Giants root cause is still fixed, just differently now.** A
division leader's own `gamesBack` reads 0 whether its lead is a nail-biter
or a 20+ game runaway, so `playoffProximityScore` also takes a
`divisionLeadMargin` (the runner-up's own `gamesBack`, computed once per
division in `parseMlbStandingsResponse`) and discounts a comfortable
leader's `stakes` the same way it already discounts a team chasing from
behind — floored at 2, never automatically maxed at 10 just for holding
first place. The same direction was applied to NBA and EPL. Previously
this fed into a gate on the fame *bonus itself*; now it simply keeps
`stakes` honest as its own axis, and a real blowout no longer needs
`watchability` to be capped at all, since fame no longer inflates the
overall score enough on its own to rescue a lopsided, low-stakes,
low-skill game.

**`divisionLeadMargin` alone still can't tell a comfortable-but-early lead
apart from a comfortable, imminent-clinch one.** It's a snapshot of
today's standings with no idea how many games are even left to play — "6
games up in June" and "6 games up with a week left" read identically.
`playoffProximityScore` prefers the MLB Stats API's own `magicNumber`
whenever a division leader hasn't clinched yet (see
`sport-signals.mjs`'s `parseMagicNumber`) — a real win-or-opponent-loss
countdown that already bakes the remaining schedule in, so a small one is
verifiable imminent-clinch drama, not just a guess from the lead size
alone. Falls back to `divisionLeadMargin` once the leader has clinched
(the API stops reporting a magic number at that point) — a clinched
leader still has real, lesser stakes (seeding, a title, a milestone), same
as before. Validated against real reporting and the live MLB Stats API
response (2026-09-23): Cleveland Guardians, AL Central, division lead
margin only 1 over a Chicago White Sox team a single game back — a real,
live race per contemporary coverage — magic number 5, both reading as
genuinely tense. The slope (0.25/point, gentler than `divisionLeadMargin`'s
own 0.8/point) was chosen specifically so a magic number this small still
lands close to what the already-tuned `divisionLeadMargin` reading gives
an equally tense same-day race.

**Star/team power — MLB's own version of EPL's "Big Six".** Direct
instruction: "we prioritize star/team power." A pure win%/standings-based
score has no way to see that a marquee, big-market franchise draws real,
national attention essentially independent of this particular season's
record — the same gap `MLB_RIVALRY_PAIRS`/`EPL_BIG_CLUBS` already cover for
a specific historic pairing or England's biggest clubs, but MLB had no
per-club (rather than per-pairing) equivalent. `MLB_BIG_CLUBS`
(`sport-duration.mjs`) is a short, deliberately conservative list of MLB's
biggest national brands — either side alone qualifies, same as
`isEplBigClub`. Stacks additively with a genuine rivalry (a Yankees @ Red
Sox game is both, and gets more lift than either fact alone) rather than
competing with it. This is exactly the feature whose interaction with the
old competitiveness-gated model caused the Brewers/Phillies blackout above
— fixed by the full rewrite this whole section now describes, not by
retuning the old gate further.

**National broadcast — MLB's own gap, not just NBA's.** MLB never had NBA's
own `isNationalBroadcast` bonus at all, despite the exact same real-world
data (ESPN's own `broadcasts[].names`) already being fetched for every
fixture. Live case caught directly from what a real TV network actually
pushes, not a heuristic guess (direct instruction: "look what actual TV
networks and public media actually push"): Cleveland Guardians @ Boston Red
Sox — a live, 1-game-back AL Central race, magic number 5 — was tagged
plain `ESPN` in the real fetched data specifically on 2026-09-24, the one
day ESPN chose to air it nationally (independently confirmed against a live
web search of ESPN's own broadcast slate); the same two teams' game the
very next day carried only `MLB.TV`. Before this signal existed, both days
scored identically (a `bestMatchScore` of 7.1) from team/stakes signals
alone — a `0.3` margin over a same-slot rival (Cincinnati Reds @ Atlanta
Braves, whose own division leader had already clinched, `stakes` discounted
to 6) narrow enough to fall inside the variety-rotation mechanism's own
`0.6` close-call threshold (see [Back-to-back variety](#back-to-back-variety-whole-window-rotation-among-real-close-contenders)),
so rotation spread the pick across both days — handing the real ESPN night
to the stakes-less Reds/Braves game instead of the actual marquee race.
`MLB_NATIONAL_BROADCAST_NETWORKS` (`sport-duration.mjs`) is a short,
exact-match list (`ESPN`, `ESPN2`, `ABC`, `FOX`, `FS1`, `TBS`, `Apple TV+`,
`Peacock`, `MLB Network`) — deliberately excludes `MLB.TV` (every
out-of-market game ever, not a producer's choice) and `ESPN Unlmtd` (a
bundled streaming tier seen on ordinary games with nothing special about
them, unlike plain `ESPN`).

**Extended to Premier League too, but deliberately much narrower — direct
instruction: "make sure EPL has no American bias," then, after an initial
"exclude it entirely" pass, "check it one more time if bias is small enough
but implement it."** ESPN's own soccer scoreboard API — the only broadcast
data this pipeline can fetch for EPL at all — only ever reports the US
rights-holder feed (`NBC`, `NBCSN`, `Peacock`, `USA Network`, `Universo`;
verified live, 2026-09: a `region=gb`/`lang=en-gb` query param returns an
*empty* `broadcasts` list, never real Sky Sports/TNT Sports/BBC data), so
there's no way to ask the actual British broadcasters who really decide
EPL's own "Super Sunday"/Monday Night Football marquee picks. The
re-check, live, against a real 6-matchweek sample (2026-08-23 through
2026-09-20) with real kickoff times cross-referenced: the plain
`NBC`/`NBCSN` broadcast-*network* tier consistently lined up with that
week's own STANDALONE kickoff slot — the one time window nothing else
played that week (the real Sky Sports/TNT Sports showcase slot) — not with
which club had an American player. A fixture that looked suspicious at
first glance (newly-promoted Coventry City @ Nottingham Forest, neither
club a global brand, getting flagship `NBC` billing) turned out to be
exactly that: Coventry's own standalone 16:30 UK kickoff that week, the
same real showcase slot Manchester City @ Manchester United and Manchester
United @ Fulham also held on their own weeks — not NBC elevating Coventry
for Haji Wright (the club's own real USMNT signing that season). A genuine
counter-example ruled nationality-based favoritism out further: Crystal
Palace (Chris Richards, USMNT) got the *lowest* tier (`Peacock`-only) in
this same sample, not an elevated one. The *wider* `USA Network`/`Peacock`
tier is a different story — confirmed confounded with NBC's own domestic
Saturday programming calendar (which Saturdays it even has a broadcast-network
slot open) as much as with real magnitude, and where it does track
anything, it's redundant with `EPL_BIG_CLUBS` already above, not new
signal. `EPL_NATIONAL_BROADCAST_NETWORKS` (`sport-duration.mjs`) is
therefore just `['NBC', 'NBCSN']` — the narrow tier that traces back to
the league's own real scheduling choice, excluding the wider one that
doesn't reliably mean anything. `isDerby`/`isBigClub` (real UK
football-culture facts) remain EPL's other two fame factors, unchanged.

### Known scoring limitations

Stated plainly rather than left silently unaddressed:

- **EPL has no recent-form signal.** ESPN's own `/standings` endpoint for
  `soccer/eng.1` (the same one NBA uses) has no per-team streak/last-5
  figure at all, confirmed against a real live response — only points,
  goal difference, and rank. It *does* have a real table-position stakes
  signal (Champions League/relegation proximity, via
  `parseEplStandingsResponse`), just not the recent-form depth MLB/NBA get
  from their own standings sources.
- **No injury data, and no real-time media/narrative signal, in the
  deterministic scoring engine itself.** Neither is knowable from data
  `objective-score.mjs`/`sport-signals.mjs` already fetch. Adding either
  back into the deterministic score for every fixture would mean a new
  paid data source, or the same per-fixture search/grounding integration
  that was tried and abandoned earlier for burning free-tier quota. A
  bounded, at-most-once-a-day, Google-Search-grounded exception was
  reintroduced later purely for one day's headline recommendation slot
  (see [The Gemini Tie-Break: A Removed
  Experiment](#the-gemini-tie-break-a-removed-experiment)) — but it was
  removed too, per direct instruction that its real billed cost outweighed
  its improvement, so there is once again no AI input anywhere in this
  engine.
- **F1's per-race modifiers (safety car, weather) aren't modeled.** Neither
  is knowable before a race starts from data this build already has, and
  adding real weather data would mean taking on a new API key/dependency
  this build doesn't currently need for anything else — deliberately not
  done without that being a real, separate decision (the same trade-off
  `public/lib/sport-duration.mjs` documents for the duration model, see
  [Duration & Broadcast-Source Resolution](#duration--broadcast-source-resolution)).

## The Viewing Plan Algorithm

A viewer can only watch one thing at a time, so 推薦賽事 ("recommended
fixtures") isn't a set of independent "this one's good" judgments — it's
**one continuous back-to-back plan for the day**, built by `computeDayPlan`
in `public/lib/recommendation.mjs`.

### Core scheduling

- A fixture whose **local** start time falls between midnight and 5am is
  never a candidate for the plan, however good its score — this site won't
  tell a viewer a 4am kickoff is unmissable. It still shows up in 所有賽事
  ("all fixtures"), just never in the plan.
- The plan itself is the maximum-total-score set of **non-overlapping**
  fixtures for the day — a real weighted-interval-scheduling chain
  (`computeDayPlan` / `weightedIntervalSchedule`), not a per-match
  threshold, and not "highest score wins its own little slot, everything
  else nearby is quality-gated or dropped" (both were tried in earlier
  versions and either hid good games or stopped producing an actual plan).
- **Best game of the day first.** When that highest-total chain would
  trade the day's single best game for two lesser ones fitting either
  side of it, the best game is forced in and the rest of the day planned
  around it (`BEST_OF_DAY`). Only when it's clearly the best — more than
  `VARIETY_CLOSE_CALL_GAP` (0.6) ahead of every game it would push out;
  inside that gap the games count as equally good and the fuller day
  wins. It's looked for around forced picks (pins, variety turns, F1), so
  it never undoes a variety rotation.
- **F1 always takes its slot** (`ALWAYS_PICK_SPORTS`), whatever else is on
  and however the scores compare — before started-game locks and the
  best-game rule. Whatever it overlaps (typically a Premier League match on
  a European evening) stays in its swipe stack regardless of the score
  gap, and F1 stays in that game's stack after a swipe, so it's always
  swappable both ways. A viewer's pin beats it; quiet hours still apply.
- A pick's swipeable card stack holds every fixture that **clashes with
  that pick** (the plan can't hold both) **but with no other pick** of the
  day, so swapping it in still connects with the rest of the plan
  (`computeDayPlan`'s `alternativeIds`, `schedulingClash`). It's judged
  against the plan, not by how much the two games overlap each other. An
  earlier version required the overlap to cover 75% of the shorter game
  (`isNearTotalOverlap`), which hid a real either/or when a doubleheader
  moved one game an hour earlier (9/26 Taiwan time: Cubs @ Red Sox 06:00
  vs Orioles @ Yankees 07:05, 62% overlap). A game that clashes with two
  picks isn't in either stack, since taking it would break the chain.
  This grouping is a **presentation label only**, computed *after* the plan is already decided — every individual
  fixture is always a real candidate for the scheduler itself, never
  pre-collapsed to one representative per overlap group ahead of time (an
  earlier version did that and could silently lose the actually-best
  plan).
- Two games **clash only when their expected times overlap by more than
  `ACCEPTED_OVERLAP_MINUTES` (10)** — missing the first few minutes of the
  next game is worth watching both. Expected time is the pre-game length
  estimate (or less, once live/finished data says the game is shorter):
  a game running long overlaps the next pick, it never knocks it out of
  the plan mid-day. This replaced a padded block (+12% for MLB, plus a
  10-minute transition buffer) that on 9/25 Taiwan time made Rays @
  Yankees (07:05, over by 09:42) "clash" with Padres @ Dodgers (10:10) and
  dropped the Dodgers game.
- Any card whose start overlaps an **earlier** match — regardless of
  whether either one made the plan — gets a small note saying so and for
  how long ("與「X」重疊 45 分鐘"), a plain fact about the schedule shown
  independently of the plan itself.
- The day's live and upcoming picks come first, in start-time order, and
  its finished picks go below them (`pinCurrentOrNext`), so whatever is
  live now, or failing that the soonest still to come, is always on top.

### Games that already started are locked into the day's plan

The plan is recomputed on every refresh, so a finished game used to be
re-scored from ESPN's post-game feed (no pre-game line any more, standings
already counting the result, the real duration instead of the estimate).
After an app update or a reopen more than 30 minutes later, the pre-game
values weren't around to carry forward at all. The rescored game could lose
its slot to a different one and reshuffle the rest of the day - reported as
"a recommended game ended and it started recommending other games, killing
the day's schedule".

`app.js` now remembers the last plan it rendered for each day (per sport
filter) in localStorage (`matchfind-day-plan-history`, kept back to
yesterday). Any pick from that plan that has already started, live or
finished, is passed to `computeDayPlan` as `lockedIds` (see
`startedPlanLockIds` in `public/lib/recommendation.mjs`) and forced into
its slot, still labeled 推薦. Upcoming picks aren't locked and can still
change with fresher data, but only around what already started. A real
swipe-to-pin still wins over a lock it clashes with.

**Every deploy starts every browser completely fresh.** A live-reported bug
directly motivated this: a viewer who saw a bad recommendation once, from a
bug that got fixed and deployed minutes later, kept seeing that exact same
wrong pick after reloading the fixed site — the lock designed to protect a
good recommendation from being reshuffled was just as effective at
protecting a bad one from ever being corrected. `app.js`'s very first
top-level statement (`wipeStorageOnNewBuild`) compares this build's own
stamped `APP_BUILD_ID` against a marker (`matchfind-app-build-id`) this
browser last stored, and on any mismatch deletes *every* `matchfind-*`
localStorage key — not just the day plan history and match snapshot, but
also settings, pins, live-sticky ids, and `matchfind-pregame-scoring`
(the frozen pre-game score cache) — before any of them ever gets loaded.
`matchfind-pregame-scoring` used to be a deliberate exception (kept across
an update specifically so it *would* survive), but that meant a scoring
formula change (a new weight, a new bonus) could keep losing to a value an
older deploy's formula had already frozen in for however long that
fixture stayed frozen — direct instruction to wipe it too, so a shipped
change always applies everywhere, immediately. Reusing the same fresh,
complete, freshly-fetched data every load (see the next paragraph) is what
keeps this from reintroducing the original reshuffling bug: nothing about
day-plan stability actually depends on state surviving *across* deploys,
only on it surviving the rest of *one* already-in-progress day, which the
locking above still does unconditionally.

**Every day's plan is always built from that whole calendar day's own
complete match list — including any game that's already finished — plus
every other day already fetched in the same window, never from a partial
or "still ahead" subset.** `computeDayPlan` treats a finished match as a
real candidate, not something to drop the moment it ends (see that
function's own top comment), and `computeVarietyRotation`/
`computeWindowPlan` always run across the *entire* fetched window
(`state.days`, every day present even when empty) rather than one day in
isolation — a multi-day rotation run needs to see the whole series to
split it fairly, and a day missing from that map would otherwise silently
stitch two unrelated repeats together across the gap. This is what makes a
freshly wiped browser safe to build from immediately after an update: the
live fetch itself already contains the whole picture a day's plan needs,
so there's nothing about a cross-deploy cache that the schedule actually
depended on to avoid "going broken".

### Duration, endurance, and the no-clock-sport overrun buffer

A fixture's own `enduranceScore` decides how much of its nominal length
actually blocks the next pick from starting
(`effectiveDurationMinutes`) — a fixture unlikely to stay watchable to the
end frees the schedule up sooner than its full listed length would
suggest.

**Baseball, and other no-clock sports, get a real overrun buffer, not a
discount.** A sport with no game clock (MLB — extra innings, rain delays)
is statistically more likely to run *long* than short in real time, never
the other way around: a standard 9-inning game already averages roughly
2h40m of playing time alone (per MLB's own officially published
time-of-game figures), and extra innings or a rain delay routinely add
30-60+ real minutes on top with no matching mechanism that ever finishes a
game meaningfully early.

An earlier version of this pipeline treated that same uncertainty as a
*discount* — shrinking the reserved block for a low-reliability sport —
which was backwards, and was the direct cause of a reported bug: the
scheduler would offer a next pick only about 2h13m into a genuinely great
MLB game, producing 40-80 real-minute overlaps once the broadcast actually
ran anywhere near its own average length.
`DURATION_OVERRUN_BUFFER_BY_RELIABILITY`/`schedulingDurationMinutes`
(`public/lib/recommendation.mjs`) now only ever *pad* a no-clock sport's
reserved block on top of the endurance-adjusted figure, never shrink it
below that value judgment — football/F1 (a real game clock) get no pad at
all; MLB gets the largest. This duration is always an *estimate*, never a
guaranteed end time — ESPN's own live status (`isFinished`) is what
actually decides a match is over; this only decides how much time the plan
reserves before offering something else.

**The overrun buffer only ever applies before a match is over.** Once
ESPN's own status confirms a fixture is finished, `durationMinutes` (see
`finishedDurationMinutes` in `public/lib/match-builder.mjs`) stops being a
pre-game guess and becomes an elapsed-time-since-kickoff estimate instead,
and `schedulingDurationMinutes` stops padding it any further — there's no
forward uncertainty left to hedge once the real length is already known.
This is the direct fix for a reported bug: a finished MLB game that
genuinely ran 30-60 minutes *shorter* than its own pre-game prediction
still had another 25% padded on top of that longer, now-known-wrong guess,
which kept blocking a next match that could obviously, actually follow it.

**A separate bug: finished-match durations that kept growing across
refreshes.** `finishedDurationMinutes` computes `now - startTimeUtc` fresh
on every refresh, and this app has no scheduled rebuild anymore (it runs
live in the browser, on both the 60-second near-term and 5-minute
full-window polls — see [Live Match Data &
Refresh](#live-match-data--refresh)). A finished match that stayed in the
fetched window (today plus one day back) had its own reported duration
keep growing toward its per-sport cap purely from how long the viewer's
tab stayed open or how late they reopened it — a real, live-confirmed case
showed a match finished roughly 7 hours earlier sitting at exactly the
360-minute MLB cap, right next to an upcoming match's flat 190-minute
estimate.

This was fixed in two stages:

1. `app.js`'s `mergeFreshMatches` now *freezes* a match's own
   `durationMinutes` the first time this browser ever sees it finished
   (preferring `pollLiveMatches`'s own last live-tracked value from the
   moment it actually ended, when one exists) and carries it forward
   unchanged on every later merge, rather than recomputing it fresh each
   time.
2. Freezing only stops the value from *growing further* — it does nothing
   for a match whose very first observation already happens long after the
   final out, which the same "no scheduled rebuild, continuous polling"
   architecture makes the common case, not the rare one. A further
   live-reported case showed a match's first-ever fetch already about
   2000+ minutes past kickoff, so `finishedDurationMinutes` clamped it at
   MLB's then-360-minute cap on that very first observation, then froze it
   there. This was fixed in `match-builder.mjs` with two further changes:
   each sport's cap in `FINISHED_DURATION_CAP_MINUTES_BY_SPORT` is now a
   genuinely realistic worst-case broadcast length (MLB lowered 360 → 280)
   rather than "high enough that a stale fetch looks obviously wrong,"
   since a late fetch is now the norm; and once elapsed-since-kickoff
   exceeds that cap, `finishedDurationMinutes` no longer trusts "elapsed
   since start" as a length signal at all — it falls back to
   `pregameEstimateMinutes`, the same real per-fixture prediction
   (`computeDurationMinutes`) an upcoming match already shows. A
   late-observed finished match now displays an honest, fixture-aware
   estimate instead of the arbitrary cap value, and every finished MLB
   match observed hours-to-a-day late now shows roughly 155-175 minutes
   (matching real per-team/venue predictions) instead of a flat cap.

**The endurance-based shrink can't claim a no-clock sport's game is
basically over just because it isn't tense.** A real slate once scheduled
a next MLB pick only about 2h25m after the first one started, with a
genuine overlap — the first game's own low `enduranceScore` had shrunk its
reserved block (`effectiveDurationMinutes`) down toward
`ENDURANCE_DURATION_FLOOR` (40% of nominal), even though a "not that tense"
MLB game still plays all 9 innings in roughly the same real clock time as a
close one (fewer mound visits/pitching changes trims a little off a
lopsided game, not 30-60%). `SCHEDULING_DURATION_FLOOR_BY_RELIABILITY`
(`public/lib/recommendation.mjs`) now floors a no-clock sport's
*scheduling* duration at 85% of its own nominal length, regardless of how
low its endurance-based value judgment goes — the shrink still fully
applies to the *score* (`enduranceScore`'s own weight in `bestMatchScore`),
this floor only stops it from also claiming the broadcast itself is nearly
half over. High/medium-reliability sports (a real game clock) get no
floor — their own real end time is already clock-bound regardless of score
margin, so the existing endurance-based shrink already applies to them in
full, unchanged. A finished match is never floored (or padded) either way —
its own `durationMinutes` is already the real observed length once ESPN
confirms the fixture over.

**Once a fixture is actually live**, `estimateLiveDurationMinutes`
(`public/lib/recommendation.mjs`, called from `pollLiveMatches` — see
[Live Score/Odds Polling](#live-scoreodds-polling)) further corrects this
same `durationMinutes` field from ESPN's own real-time progress (current
inning/quarter+clock/match-minute), blended with the pre-game estimate
rather than replacing it outright. This is the direct answer to MLB's own
reported "estimate drops out by 30-60 real minutes" gap: the pre-game
formula is still a genuine prediction with real uncertainty (extra innings
and rain delays are not knowable in advance), but a live game's own actual
pace can now correct that estimate in real time instead of the schedule
staying pinned to a single guess for the whole broadcast.

### No cross-day "variety" penalty on ordinary scoring

An earlier version of `computeWindowPlan` applied a small, decaying
cross-day repeat penalty to a matchup already picked on an earlier day,
plus a sport-concentration penalty once one sport dominated recent picks.
This was removed entirely per direct feedback: this site's own primary
viewer mostly doesn't watch on weekdays at all, so comparing today's best
game against whatever won a weekday slot he never actually watched just
buried a genuinely great weekend game for a "variety" benefit that never
applied to him. `computeDayPlan`'s `planningScore` is now exactly
`effectiveScore` plus a live-match excitement bonus (`applyLiveExcitementBonus`,
see [Live Score/Odds Polling](#live-scoreodds-polling)) — nothing else
nudges which fixture wins a slot across days.
`computeWindowPlan`'s own `sportConcentration` return value still exposes
the whole window's actual sport split as a pure diagnostic (for anyone
inspecting a `matches.json`-shaped snapshot directly, or a copy fed to
`scripts/evaluate-recommendations.mjs`, see [Getting
Started](#getting-started)) — it just no longer feeds any scoring
decision.

### Back-to-back variety: whole-window rotation among real close contenders

Direct feedback, later on, pushed back the other way: the deterministic
scheduler's own math will happily recommend the exact same matchup three
(or more) real calendar days running whenever a live series/back-to-back
naturally scores best every one of those days — "I don't like that, add
variety... but real good games get kept, like the Dodgers @ Padres
back-to-back game." This is a deliberately *narrower* reintroduction of the
cross-day repeat penalty described above: that older version compared
today's pick against *any* recent day in the whole fetched window,
including weekdays this viewer never watches, which is exactly what
silently buried a genuinely great weekend game for a "variety" benefit
nobody wanted. The new mechanism only ever looks at days that are already
part of the same natural winning streak.

**Getting the exemption criterion right took two iterations.** The first
cut exempted a matchup once its own `skill` reached 7, on the theory that a
"real good game" should always keep repeating. Direct correction: "I want
variety, because the Brewer time they got equal match ups[,] the dodger one
in it's time it's the best[,] no alternative." Milwaukee Brewers @
Philadelphia Phillies (skill 8) had several genuinely comparable
alternatives in its own time slot every day it repeated, so a skill-based
bar wrongly exempted it anyway. The criterion was switched to the real
score *margin* over the closest rival — exempt only past
`VARIETY_CLOSE_CALL_GAP` (now 0.6, originally 0.5), a threshold chosen to sit directly between
the real, live-measured ranges: Brewers @ Phillies's own margin over its
closest rival was 0.15-0.45, while San Diego Padres @ Los Angeles Dodgers's
was 0.75-1.0 — despite both technically having an `.alternativeIds` entry
under the wider, UI-facing `ALTERNATIVE_MAX_SCORE_GAP` (2.5).

**The mechanism itself was then redesigned entirely**, since the
margin-based fix still only ever penalized the current incumbent once it
had won twice, handing the very next day to whichever single alternative
happened to be closest that specific day — never giving more than one real
alternative an actual turn. Direct correction: "it should first determine
how many days, then see how many alternative[s], if there is [more than
one] alternative... three day[s] mean each winning once."
`computeVarietyRotation` (`public/lib/recommendation.mjs`) now works over
the *whole* fetched window at once — feasible only because Match Find
already has every day's match data in hand before any one day renders,
unlike the earlier cross-day penalty, which only ever looked backward:

1. Find every maximal run of consecutive real calendar days where the same
   matchup naturally wins its own slot.
2. For a run of 2+ days, build a pool: that matchup plus every *other*
   matchup that was a genuinely close rival (within `VARIETY_CLOSE_CALL_GAP`)
   on *any* day of the run.
3. Drop any *other* pool member that was only ever close on a single day
   of the run — it isn't a recurring rival to rotate into, just a
   coincidence (some unrelated game that happened to overlap the
   incumbent's slot on the one day it's actually scheduled, with a score
   that happened to land inside the generous `VARIETY_CLOSE_CALL_GAP`
   window). There's no "variety" value in a one-off: a run rotates
   *because* the same matchup keeps recurring, and a single day has
   nothing to recur into. "Close on a day" here means the same matchup
   plays that day within `VARIETY_CLOSE_CALL_GAP` of the pick, whether or
   not the two overlap. Live case (9/26-9/27 Taiwan time): the Red Sox's
   doubleheader moved Cubs @ Red Sox an hour ahead of Orioles @ Yankees
   (0.4 behind both days) on 9/26, so Orioles was only a same-slot
   alternative on 9/27. Judged by slot alone it looked like a one-off,
   and Cubs @ Red Sox won both days. A member still only gets a day where
   it really is a same-slot alternative. And when the run has no rival
   that recurs across days at all, a one-day rival is kept: it's the
   only variety the run has, with no multi-day rival for it to bump.
   Live case: ESPN moved Orioles @ Yankees' 9/27 game into a 9/26
   doubleheader, leaving it close on 9/26 only.
4. If the (now-filtered) pool has more than one member, assign each day to
   a distinct pool member via a **maximum bipartite matching** (Kuhn's
   algorithm — days on one side, pool members on the other, an edge
   wherever a member was actually close on that specific day), covering as
   many *distinct* members as the run's own days can support, rather than
   a fixed `day i → pool[i]` rotation that can't adapt when a later day's
   own assignment turns out infeasible. Members are placed strongest-first
   (best score on any day of the run; ties go to the run's own matchup,
   then to whoever was close on more days), so when a run has more
   contenders than days, the one left out is always the weakest. A
   contender close on more than one day can still need the matching's own
   augmenting step (moving a more flexible, already-placed member to
   another of *its* eligible days) to get a day of its own — restricted to
   the filtered pool, this only ever moves a day between two genuine
   multi-day rivals, never hands one to a single-day one-off.
5. Arrange the days: fewest back-to-back repeats first, then the strongest
   game on Fri/Sat/Sun, then stronger contenders on earlier days.

**Games that already happened can't reshape a series.** Four things kept
moving a rotated lineup after the fact, each from a game that had already
finished or from an unrelated one-off that happened to share its slot:

- A finished game was re-scored from post-game data, with no pre-game line
  and standings that already counted the result. Guardians @ Red Sox on
  9/23 ended up 0.6 behind the series' top, fell out of the pool at 0.5,
  and flipped Wed/Thu. The build now also looks up the pre-game line for
  finished games, not just live ones. `app.js` saves every fixture's
  pre-game scoring in localStorage (`matchfind-pregame-scoring`) so a game
  that's already started keeps the score it was recommended with for the
  rest of that same day, rather than getting rescored out from under
  itself mid-refresh (see "Games that already started are locked into the
  day's plan" above). This cache — like every other piece of saved state —
  is wiped on every new deploy (`wipeStorageOnNewBuild`, see "Local-Only
  Data & Privacy" below), so a scoring change always applies fresh rather
  than being overridden by a value an older deploy's formula already froze
  in. The gap is now 0.6, still inside the observed dividing line, to
  absorb that post-game drift.
- A finished game that ran long had its whole real length reserved on the
  schedule. Brewers @ Phillies ran 210 minutes, its block ran into the
  10:10 Padres @ Dodgers start, and that day's natural plan changed.
  `schedulingDurationMinutes` now caps a finished game at its pre-game
  estimate (`plannedDurationMinutes`). A game that's over can't block
  anything that starts after it anyway.
- Picks that already started are passed to `computeVarietyRotation` as
  fixed days (see "Games that already started are locked into the day's
  plan" above). The rest of the series rotates around them, without giving
  a locked matchup a second day. Plans are only recorded, and live picks
  only made sticky, once the full window has loaded. The first
  couple-of-days render can't see a whole series, so its pick can be a
  stopgap.
- A single-day one-off bumped a genuine multi-day rival out of a run
  entirely. The matching (step 4 above) places members strongest-first and
  lets a member bump a weaker, already-placed one to another of its own
  eligible days — safe among genuine rivals, but a scarce one-off used to
  be eligible for the matching at all: live case, Miami Marlins @ Chicago
  Cubs (eligible only on the single day it plays, 6.75) bumped the
  incumbent Milwaukee Brewers @ Philadelphia Phillies (7.1, eligible every
  day of the run) off its own opening day and onto a different one, purely
  because Marlins had nowhere else to go — a strictly worse matching than
  simply leaving Marlins out, since it swapped a stronger member out for a
  weaker one instead. Reported directly: "recommending marlins vs cubs,
  which is the broken state." Step 3 above is the fix: a member only ever
  enters the matching at all once it's shown up close on at least two days
  of the run.

**Two further corrections were needed once this shipped and was tested
against live data.** First: "if Brewer win day three outright then day one
should be someone else." The first cut of the whole-window rotation still
used a fixed `pool[i % pool.length]` assignment, so a later day's own
assignee turning out not-actually-close-that-day (falling back to the
incumbent) meant the incumbent won *twice* while some other real contender
never won at all — exactly this double-booking. This was replaced with the
maximum-matching approach described above. Second, caught live-testing that
very fix: penalizing the incumbent's own `planningScore` only ever
guaranteed the incumbent *lost*, not that the intended rotation winner in
particular *won* — `computeDayPlan` re-solves the whole day's schedule
fresh once a score changes, and a candidate entirely outside the rotation's
own pool can end up winning instead, simply by fitting the day's other
constraints slightly better once the incumbent dropped. A live-observed
case: penalizing Milwaukee Brewers @ Philadelphia Phillies to hand a day to
Cleveland Guardians @ Boston Red Sox instead actually handed it to Tampa
Bay Rays @ New York Yankees — a candidate the rotation's own pool never
even considered. This was fixed by switching from a soft penalty to a hard
*force*: `mergeVarietyForcedIds` merges the rotation's own assigned winner
into the same `pinnedForDay` a real viewer pin already uses, so it wins
unconditionally — the same guarantee a real pin has, never merely "probably
wins once nudged." Since `computeDayPlan`'s own forced-pick mechanism marks
every forced id `.isPreferred` (indistinguishable from a real viewer pin —
the same underlying issue that affected the Gemini tie-break, see [The
Gemini Tie-Break: A Removed
Experiment](#the-gemini-tie-break-a-removed-experiment)),
`clearRotationIsPreferred` puts 推薦 back immediately after the real, final
`computeDayPlan` call for anything only rotation-forced in.

This was verified against a real fetch: Milwaukee Brewers @ Philadelphia
Phillies's own 3-day run had a real pool of 3 members (itself, Cleveland
Guardians @ Boston Red Sox, Tampa Bay Rays @ New York Yankees), and the
matching correctly gave each one exactly one of the three days. Tampa Bay
Rays @ Philadelphia Phillies's own 2-day run had *two* other members tied
with it at "close both days" (Baltimore Orioles @ New York Yankees, Chicago
Cubs @ Boston Red Sox) — a 3-way tie for only 2 days; the incumbent-priority
tie-break correctly still let Rays @ Phillies win one of its own two days
rather than losing both to the other two tied members. San Diego Padres @
Los Angeles Dodgers stayed untouched throughout both runs' whole span (pool
size 1, nothing ever close). A before/after diff across the whole fetched
window showed exactly 3 intended days differ, zero unintended changes
anywhere else, and zero `.isPreferred` mislabels with no real pins anywhere
in the window.

#### A real national-broadcast pick is exempt too, not just a wide-margin one

Direct instruction, after live-verifying a real misfire: "look at what
actual TV networks and public media actually push." Padres @ Dodgers above
is exempt from rotation because it has no real *alternative* (pool size 1).
But a run can still have a genuine close alternative on paper (inside
`VARIETY_CLOSE_CALL_GAP`) on a day a real broadcaster has already, publicly,
chosen to air that exact game nationally — and rotation used to spread the
pick away from that day anyway, purely because some other candidate's score
happened to land close enough. Live case (2026-09-24): Cleveland Guardians @
Boston Red Sox — a live, 1-game-back AL Central race, magic number 5 — was
ESPN's own real national broadcast specifically that day (independently
confirmed against a live web search of ESPN's own schedule), scoring 7.1
against a same-slot Cincinnati Reds @ Atlanta Braves (6.8, division already
clinched) close enough (gap 0.3) to normally rotate. Fixing the underlying
`watchability` gap (see [`national broadcast — MLB's own gap`](#the-bestmatchscore-blend)
above) widened that specific margin past `0.6`, but the *rotation mechanism
itself* simply found a different close alternative (Milwaukee Brewers @
Philadelphia Phillies, gap exactly `0.6`) to spread the pick to instead —
same wrong day, different runner-up. The real, root fix is in the rotation
mechanism, not the score: a day whose real broadcaster pick is known
(`match.isNationalBroadcast`) is added to the SAME `fixedDays` a real
already-started pick already uses (`computeVarietyRotation`, right after the
existing `lockedByDay` handling) — locked to whichever candidate the network
actually chose that day (checked across the incumbent AND every known close
rival, not just the incumbent — the real pick some days could just as
easily be the rival), never traded away for the matching algorithm's own
otherwise-blind close-score comparison. The *other* day(s) of the run still
rotate normally — this narrows the exemption to the one day ground truth
already answered, it doesn't turn the whole run into a second Padres @
Dodgers.

Extended to NBA (`isNationalBroadcast` already existed there for scoring;
this is the same real ESPN/ABC/TNT/NBA TV/Prime Video/Peacock signal, now
also read by the rotation) and, more narrowly, to Premier League — see
[`national broadcast`](#the-bestmatchscore-blend) above for the live
investigation behind `EPL_NATIONAL_BROADCAST_NETWORKS`'s own narrow
`NBC`/`NBCSN`-only scope. The exemption mechanism itself is the same for
every sport; what differs per sport is only which real broadcast labels
`isNationalBroadcast` is willing to trust as a genuine editorial pick.

### Pinning: "Prefer"

Swiping a card stack to a different card is a real commitment, not just a
peek — this *is* "Prefer." Settling on a different card pins that match as
the slot's fixed choice (`pinSlotChoice`) and rebuilds the *whole* day's
plan around it: the matches scheduled both before and after it are freshly
reasoned about relative to the pin, not just appended after whatever was
there before. Picking a shorter alternative can free up enough time for a
fixture that didn't fit before to join the plan afterward. A pin is saved
to `localStorage` (scoped to one calendar day) and survives a reload, same
as every other preference in this app — purely local, never synced
anywhere. Swiping back to whatever the algorithm would already have picked
for that slot (`naturalSlotChoice`, `public/lib/recommendation.mjs`)
*clears* the pin instead of recording one, so the card correctly reverts to
推薦 rather than staying mislabeled 偏好. A pinned card is tagged 偏好
("preferred") instead of 推薦 ("recommended") precisely because it's the
viewer's own choice overriding the algorithm, not the algorithm's own
judgment.

## Page Layout & UI

- A horizontally-scrolling **day picker** at the top — every day in the
  fetched 14-day window, all up front once the full-window refresh lands (a
  fast near-term refresh populates today/tomorrow first, see [Live Match
  Data & Refresh](#live-match-data--refresh)), no "load more" click needed
  once it has. It defaults to today, but jumps ahead to the next day that
  still has a fixture to come if today's are all already over.
- A single horizontally-scrolling row below the day picker holds both the
  **sport filter chips** (全部/英超/MLB/...), built only from sports
  actually present in the enabled set (see [Sport Priority &
  Settings](#sport-priority--settings)), and the Settings (⚙) button —
  last in that row, not first, so a growing sport list scrolls rather than
  pushing it around. Picking a chip narrows both sections below to one
  sport. Picking a sport chip that has nothing on the currently selected
  day (`ensureSelectedDayHasActiveSport`) jumps the day picker to the
  nearest day that actually has one, rather than leaving both sections
  empty for no visible reason — a real, common case for MLB specifically:
  Taiwan is far enough ahead of US time zones that a US evening fixture
  almost always lands on the viewer's *next* local calendar date (see
  `localDateKey`), so "today" can be genuinely, correctly empty for MLB
  while a full night's worth of real matches sit one tab over on "明天".
  Disabling a sport in Settings while its chip is the active filter resets
  the filter to 全部 the same way, rather than leaving the page stuck
  showing nothing for a sport that no longer exists in the enabled set.
- For the selected day: **推薦賽事** ("recommended fixtures") — the curated
  back-to-back lineup described in [The Viewing Plan
  Algorithm](#the-viewing-plan-algorithm), closest/live match first.
- Below that: **所有賽事** ("all fixtures") — every fixture that day,
  regardless of whether it made the recommended lineup, so nothing is
  actually hidden, just not pushed as a pick.
- Each fixture shows both teams with **home/away labels** (主/客), logo,
  and bilingual English/Traditional-Chinese name; the venue and (when
  known) Taiwan broadcast channel are shown the same bilingual/Chinese way,
  with a small color-coded badge per service (see [Broadcast Service
  Registry](#broadcast-service-registry) — there is no separate "已訂閱"
  mark on the card itself; which services count as the viewer's own only
  ever affects scoring, silently). MLB in particular is very often carried
  on both 緯來體育台 and 愛爾達體育台 at once — `resolveWhereToWatchTw`
  (see [Duration & Broadcast-Source
  Resolution](#duration--broadcast-source-resolution)) always names 愛爾達
  體育台 when both apply, as a fixed rule rather than an answer that could
  vary fixture to fixture.
- Each fixture shows one time range ("7:00 下午 – 9:35 下午") plus a short
  relative countdown next to it, instead of three separate stacked labels —
  the countdown switches from hours to whole days once a fixture is more
  than 24 hours out ("2 天 5 小時後", not "53 小時後"), both computed from
  the fixture's own predicted broadcast length.
- No competitiveness/watchability meters appear on the card — just the
  one-sentence reason. The numbers still drive the plan itself behind the
  scenes; the page itself only ever shows the recommendation, not the data
  behind it.
- A fixture ESPN has scheduled but hasn't set a real kickoff time for yet
  (almost always a playoff game whose bracket slot is set before its exact
  date/time is — see `isTimeTbd` in `build-data.mjs`) never enters the day
  picker/recommended lineup at all, since there's no trustworthy time to
  schedule it against. It's listed once, separately, in a **時間未定**
  section at the bottom instead. A bracket slot with no real teams assigned
  yet ("TBD @ TBD") is skipped entirely rather than shown as a blank card.
- F1 weekends surface **qualifying and (on a sprint weekend) the sprint
  race** as their own fixtures, not just Saturday/Sunday's race — each a
  genuinely watchable event in its own right, keyed off ESPN's own
  per-session abbreviation (`Race`/`Qual`/`SR`, confirmed stable across
  both ordinary and sprint weekends). Session times were cross-checked
  against Formula1.com's own official timetable and matched exactly. F1's
  Taiwan broadcaster is always 愛爾達體育台 — the MLB-specific "Apple TV
  exclusive slate" override (see `resolveWhereToWatchTw`) explicitly does
  not apply to F1, even though ESPN's own `broadcast` field for F1 also
  happens to say Apple TV (its real international rights holder — a
  genuinely different, unrelated fact from who carries it in Taiwan).

### The swipeable card stack

A recommended fixture with a genuinely can't-watch-both alternative
(clashes with it and with no other pick, see [The Viewing Plan
Algorithm](#the-viewing-plan-algorithm)) renders as a **horizontally
swipeable card stack** — only one card is on screen by default, the other
a deliberate swipe away, with dots marking how many there are. Swiping is a
real choice: settling on a different card pins that match as the slot's
committed pick and rebuilds the rest of the day's plan around it
(`pinSlotChoice`, see [Pinning: "Prefer"](#pinning-prefer)). A card whose
start overlaps an earlier match — whether or not either one made the plan —
gets a small note naming that match and how long they overlap
(`computeOverlapRange` in `buildMatchCard`).

**The stack is driven entirely by explicit Touch/Mouse events and a CSS
`transform`** (`buildMatchStack` in `app.js`), not native CSS scroll-snap.
An earlier design (`scrollLeft` + scroll-snap + a `requestAnimationFrame`
poll waiting for native momentum to "settle") went through three separate
rounds of reported regressions — stuck cards, flicking back, cards landing
on the wrong index, a stack's dots jumping/shrinking mid-swipe — because
real touch momentum and native scroll-snap timing vary enough across
devices and browsers that no fixed poll/threshold tuned against one device
stayed correct on every other one. A `transform` is just a plain CSS
property this code sets directly
(`translateX(calc(-index*100% + dragPx))`) and reads back exactly what it
set — there's no separate physics engine whose output has to be inferred
after the fact. `touchstart`/`touchmove`/`touchend`/`touchcancel` (plus a
`mousedown`/`mousemove`/`mouseup` fallback for non-touch input) track the
gesture directly: a small movement threshold decides horizontal-swipe vs.
vertical-page-scroll before committing to either (so a swipe starting on a
stack never fights the page's own scroll), a live drag renders immediately
as the finger moves (with resistance past either end, never a hard stop),
and release commits to the next/previous card the instant it crosses a
distance-or-velocity threshold — no polling, no waiting for anything to
"settle," since nothing is still moving under the hood after that.

This is deliberately built on Touch Events, not the newer Pointer Events
API this went through first: this site's own audience is heavily iOS
Safari/PWA, and Safari's Pointer Events support, while real, has stayed
genuinely less mature than Chromium's for years (`touch-action` landed
late, `setPointerCapture`/`pointercancel` timing has had known quirks) —
exactly the kind of gap that's hard to catch in a Linux development sandbox
with no WebKit browser installed to test against, only Chromium. Touch
Events have had solid, consistent Safari support since iOS 2. The
implementation was verified against a real headless-browser reproduction
driving actual low-level touch input (Chrome DevTools Protocol's
`Input.dispatchTouchEvent`, which goes through the full browser
touch/gesture pipeline — not `dispatchEvent(new PointerEvent(...))` called
directly on one element, which bypasses that pipeline entirely and had
already given a false pass once), across a 3-card chain and a synthetic
10-game slate shaped like a real MLB night, including deliberately
imprecise diagonal gestures.

The node-reuse mechanism this replaced (keeping the exact DOM node a swipe
just landed on alive across the pin's own re-render, tracking which member
is currently pinned via `wrapper.dataset.primaryId` rather than a value
captured once at build time) is unchanged — a `transform` is just a plain
style property, though, so the extra scroll-position capture/restore the
old `scrollLeft`-based version needed around that reuse (to survive a
detach+reattach resetting scroll position on some mobile WebKit builds) is
gone; there's nothing left to reset.

**A stack's alternatives are direct conflicts only, not a whole
transitively-linked cluster.** `groupIntoSlots` groups cards by a
*transitive* chain (card 1 overlaps card 2, card 2 overlaps card 3 is
enough to union all three, even if 1 and 3 never overlap each other at
all) — harmless for a genuine 3-card cluster, but a real MLB night's own
games routinely chain 10-14 of them into *one* cluster this way (each game
reserves roughly 3-4 hours with buffer, staggered only 20-30 minutes apart
across the night). An earlier version handed the swipeable stack every
other member of that whole transitive cluster as its alternatives, so a
viewer could open what looked like a normal "pick one of these" stack and
find 10+ cards in it, most of which never actually conflicted with each
other at all — swiping through it landed on cards in no order a viewer
would recognize, and pinning one card could shuffle which other cards were
still independently recommended elsewhere, since so many pairs in a chain
that size are only linked transitively.

A first attempt at fixing this instead made a pin exclude its *entire*
transitive cluster — which "solved" the shuffling by instead silently
suppressing every one of those 10+ often-unrelated games from being
recommended at all the moment a viewer pinned just one of them, confirmed
wrong against real data before it ever shipped. `alternativeIds` in
`recommendation.mjs` is now narrowed to only the *other* candidates that
directly (pairwise) overlap the recommended pick, not every member of its
wider presentational cluster (while a pin's own hard-exclusion logic, and
the stable lookup key a pin is stored under, both stay based on the full
cluster). This keeps every stack small and locally coherent — a real "pick
one of these 2-3 games actually airing at the same time" choice — without
suppressing any other game the chain happened to also transitively touch.

### iOS Safari: the "every tap needs two taps" bug

**Symptom:** on iOS Safari (browser and Home Screen app — desktop Chrome
was fine), after one swipe on a card stack, every later tap on any button
needed two taps, until the app was backgrounded and reopened.

**Fix:** empty, passive, document-level `touchstart`/`touchend`/
`touchcancel`/`pointerdown`/`pointerup`/`pointercancel` listeners near the
top of `app.js` (search for `DO NOT REMOVE - iOS Safari`). They do nothing;
their existence is the fix. iOS WebKit handles a tap differently depending
on whether the touched spot has touch listeners, and with listeners only on
the swipeable cards, a swipe left that handling stuck and swallowed the
next tap elsewhere. **Don't remove them.**

**How it was found:** three guessed fixes (explicit
`releasePointerCapture`, deferring the re-render with `setTimeout(0)`,
switching finger swipes to Touch Events) all failed and were removed
afterwards — headless
Chromium/Playwright never reproduces iOS WebKit tap bugs, even with real CDP
touch input. What cracked it was the hidden tap log (below): the bug
vanished whenever the log was on, which pointed straight at its
document-level listeners.

**Next time something only breaks on iPhone,** start with the tap log
instead of guessing: tap the "Data last updated" line at the bottom of the
page 5 times (or open with `?debug=taps`), reproduce, then use **Copy** and
paste the result. If the bug disappears while the log is on, that alone is
a strong clue (see above).

## Sport Priority & Settings

`priorityOrder` nudges a match's `effectiveScore` up or down slightly
before it feeds `computeDayPlan`'s scheduling weight (which fixture wins a
genuinely contested, overlapping stretch of the day) — a viewer's
preferred sports win a close scheduling call a little more easily, and
their least favorite needs to be a little better to win one. The default
order is F1, NBA, Premier League, MLB. This is a
small, symmetric tilt (1st-ranked gets the biggest positive nudge,
last-ranked the biggest negative, the exact middle rank gets none), never
enough on its own to make a mediocre match beat a genuinely great one. The
order is stored in `localStorage` (per-browser, nothing sent anywhere), and
re-ranking re-runs the whole plan and re-renders immediately, without
closing the panel or reloading.

### Enabled sports (已啟用的運動)

A hard on/off toggle per sport, not a ranking — unlike priority order
above, a disabled sport never appears anywhere on the page at all, not even
in 所有賽事 (also `localStorage`, per-browser). At least one sport must
stay on. Turning a sport off also means `buildMatches` stops fetching it
entirely on the next refresh (see [Efficiency: Caching &
Fetch-Skipping](#efficiency-caching--fetch-skipping)) — a real performance
win while it stays off, restored immediately (a background full-window
refresh kicks off the moment it's turned back on) rather than waiting for
the next scheduled tier.

### No developer tools in the UI

An earlier version of Settings had a "開發者工具" section with a "匯出推薦
資料" button (a client-side JSON download of the current plan, for
inspecting against `scripts/evaluate-recommendations.mjs`). It's gone —
that's not a viewer-facing feature, and `scripts/evaluate-recommendations.mjs`
still works fine against a `matches.json`-shaped copy saved any other way
(a browser's own devtools, or `node scripts/build-data.mjs` locally, see
[Getting Started](#getting-started)). Settings now shows only what an
ordinary viewer would actually use — sport priority, enabled sports, and
one 立即重新整理 (refresh now) button.

The one exception is a **hidden** on-screen tap log (`lib/tap-log.mjs`) for
debugging iPhone-only input bugs, where there are no devtools. It's never
shown unless someone taps the "Data last updated" line 5 times (or opens
the page with `?debug=taps`), and its own **Off** button removes it. See
[iOS Safari: the "every tap needs two taps" bug](#ios-safari-the-every-tap-needs-two-taps-bug).

## Duration & Broadcast-Source Resolution

Two things that used to be either a flat guess or a per-fixture AI
judgment call are now plain, auditable rules computed entirely from ESPN's
own fixture data (plus, for duration, ESPN's own betting-odds field and,
live, ESPN's own in-progress status) — never an AI call.

### Predicted duration

`public/lib/sport-duration.mjs` — every fixture used to get one flat
per-league average (every MLB game: 190 minutes, regardless of which two
teams were playing). Real per-team pace varies by roughly 20 minutes across
MLB alone, so this is now a real formula per sport:

- **MLB**: averages each team's pace offset, plus a Coors Field venue
  modifier and a fixed 2026 Automated Ball-Strike challenge-review padding
  — all **fitted to real game lengths** (see
  [Checking durations against real games](#checking-durations-against-real-games)).
  The betting total-runs term (`mlbOddsDurationModifier`) is kept as a knob
  but set to 0: on real games it made predictions slightly worse.
- **NBA**: adds an expected-value overtime term plus a rivalry/national-
  broadcast modifier.
- **EPL**: adds a derby modifier, clamped to a realistic min/max.
- **F1**: the race session uses a per-circuit baseline (fuzzy-matched from
  ESPN's own circuit name), capped at the sport's real regulatory maximum.

Every input here is a fact already available *pre-game* from ESPN's own
scoreboard (team names, venue, national broadcaster, betting odds) —
nothing here is a guess: an unrecognized team/circuit just contributes a
neutral default rather than skewing the estimate or failing the build.
This feeds every scheduling decision downstream
(`effectiveDurationMinutes` / `schedulingDurationMinutes` / the overrun
buffer, see [The Viewing Plan Algorithm](#the-viewing-plan-algorithm)), not
just the on-card time range, so a more accurate per-fixture number improves
the whole viewing plan, not just what's printed on one card.

Once a fixture is actually live, `estimateLiveDurationMinutes`
(`public/lib/recommendation.mjs`, called from `pollLiveMatches`, see [Live
Score/Odds Polling](#live-scoreodds-polling)) further corrects this same
`durationMinutes` field from ESPN's own real-time progress (current
inning/quarter+clock/match-minute), blended with the pre-game estimate
rather than replacing it outright. This is the direct answer to MLB's own
reported "estimate drops out by 30-60 real minutes" gap: the pre-game
formula above is still a genuine prediction with real uncertainty (extra
innings and rain delays are not knowable in advance), but a live game's own
actual pace can now correct that estimate in real time instead of the
schedule staying pinned to a single guess for the whole broadcast.


### Real end times of finished games

ESPN's scoreboard has no end time, so a finished game's length used to be
"now minus start" at whichever refresh first saw it final — up to a
refresh interval plus ESPN's lag too long. Every build now looks up
finished MLB games in the MLB Stats API (`applyMlbActualEnds` in
`public/lib/sport-signals.mjs`, one request for the whole window): actual
first pitch + official game time + any delay = the real end
(`actualEndUtc`), which the card shows and the app keeps once it has it.
Checked against ESPN's own play-by-play wallclock on the final play
(Nationals @ Tigers 2026-09-23: 17:12 + 164 min = 19:56, ESPN's last play
19:56:14).

### Checking durations against real games

`node scripts/calibrate-durations.mjs` measures the MLB model against every
finished game of the season (MLB Stats API: scheduled start to final out,
leaving out weather delays and late starts) and prints a refit —
base, per-team pace, Coors, over/under term — fitted to the typical game
(absolute error) and scored on games after `--split` that the fit never
saw. It also checks the **live** estimate: ESPN play-by-play gives the
real wallclock at every half-inning start, so the live estimate is scored
at each one against when the game really ended.

First run (2026-09-25, 2,256 games):

| | Average error | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-game, hand-set model | 15.2 min (bias −2.1) | September 16.1 |
| Pre-game, refit (shipped) | 14.9 min (bias −0.3) | September 15.4; team spread ~10 min, not 19 |
| Live, old (inning in progress read as completed) | 22.3 min | 34 min short in the 3rd |
| Live, observed pace over the whole game | 14.2 min | |
| Live, played so far + remaining innings at 85% pre-game / 15% observed pace | 11.9–12.2 min | |
| Live, + outs, home lead in the 9th, score state from the 7th, 95% pre-game pace (shipped) | 10.7 min on held-out games | 7th 9.3, 8th 6.9, 9th+ 7.4 |

A single game varies by about 15 minutes whatever the formula, so
pre-game gains are small; the live estimate is where real data helps
most. Rerun the script every few weeks rather than hand-tuning.

**The live estimate never reaches the planner.** It only sets the card's
end time. The planner always works from the pre-game estimate
(`planningDurationMinutes`), so a game running long (or short) never
reshuffles the day - a finished game's real length counts only when it's
shorter than planned.

### Taiwan broadcast source

`resolveWhereToWatchTw` (`public/lib/match-builder.mjs`) — 愛爾達體育台 is
the hardcoded default for every sport this site covers. The one exception
is MLB's Apple TV "Friday Night Baseball" package, a genuine global
streaming exclusive with no regional blackout. ESPN's own `broadcast`
field (already fetched for every fixture) already reports this reliably,
so detecting it is a plain string check (`/apple\s*tv/i` against that
field, MLB fixtures only), never a live search or a model guess.

Neither of these has any AI role, and both are, and have long been, fully
deterministic from data ESPN already provides. A separate, bounded, and
since-removed AI experiment existed elsewhere in this pipeline (see [The
Gemini Tie-Break: A Removed
Experiment](#the-gemini-tie-break-a-removed-experiment)), but it never
played any part in either duration or broadcast-source resolution, or in
`objective-score.mjs`'s own scoring — it was a once-a-day tie-break layered
on top, at the recommendation-plan level, never a re-guess of duration,
broadcast, competitiveness, or watchability.

## Broadcast Service Registry

`SERVICES` in `public/app.js` maps `whereToWatchTw` text (a fixed rule's
output, not free-form AI wording) to a small badge for exactly three
services this site's owner actually tracks: 愛爾達, Apple TV, Netflix —
kept text-matched rather than collapsed to an enum only so a future third
service has a ready slot. Any *other* broadcaster still shows up as plain
text on the card either way (see `watch-text` in `buildMatchCard`) — it
just doesn't get a logo/color badge, since this registry only exists to
badge the handful of services actually worth tracking.

All three render each service's own real, official mark, hotlinked rather
than reproduced into this repo, the same posture as the team/F1 logos
pulled from ESPN's CDN elsewhere in this app: Netflix and Apple TV via
Wikimedia Commons' `Special:FilePath` hotlink redirect (confirmed live, not
assumed), 愛爾達 via 愛爾達電視's own official Android app icon on the
Google Play Store (Commons had nothing usable for that one). `logoBg`
behind each mark is a two-stop gradient, not a flat fill, purely so the
badge reads as a designed icon rather than a plain colored sticker sitting
behind the logo. If a hotlink ever fails to load, it falls back to a plain
colored-initial badge (the same `onerror` pattern as team logos) rather
than an empty box.

`DEFAULT_MY_SERVICE_IDS` names which of those the site's owner actually
subscribes to (愛爾達, Apple TV, Netflix, as of writing) — fixed, not a
per-viewer Settings toggle. An earlier version let each viewer pick their
own, which added a whole settings section for a nudge that's only ever
meaningful for this site's own owner. It only ever feeds a silent score
nudge (`OWNED_SERVICE_SCORE_BONUS`) in `resolveViewingPlan` — there is no
visible mark on the card either (an earlier version showed a small
"已訂閱" tag, dropped as one more thing competing for attention on every
card for information only this site's own owner ever acted on) — the same
tie-breaking spirit as sport priority: a great game on a service a viewer
doesn't have still shows up and can still be recommended; this only tips a
genuinely close call toward the one they can actually watch live right
now. Adding a new tracked service later is one more entry in `SERVICES`;
nothing else in the file needs to know about it, the same pattern as
`SPORT_LABELS_ZH` for sports.

## Local-Only Data & Privacy

Every per-viewer preference — sport priority order, which sports are
enabled, and which swiped match a viewer Prefers for a slot — lives in this
browser's own `localStorage` and nowhere else. There is no sign-up, no
account, and no server-side sync of any kind. An earlier version of this
site had a cross-device settings-sync feature (a shared passcode through
the same shared Cloudflare Worker `/sports-proxy` uses); it's gone now, on
purpose — one browser, one set of local preferences, nothing to pair or
lose track of across devices.

Match data and scores are fetched and scored independently by each
viewer's own browser (see [How It Works](#how-it-works)) — never shared or
synced between viewers, and never stored in `localStorage` either, since
they're cheap to re-derive live and would just go stale sitting there. (An
instant-paint snapshot of the *last successful build* is cached to
`localStorage` for perceived load time only — see [Instant Paint from a
Cached Snapshot](#instant-paint-from-a-cached-snapshot) — which is a
different thing from ongoing sync between viewers. The prebuilt snapshot
described in [Load Performance](#load-performance) is the same public
match data for everyone, built by a GitHub Action; nothing about a viewer
is ever sent to build it or read back from it.)

There is also only ever one recommendation system, not a choice between
competing ones — see [The `bestMatchScore`
Blend](#the-bestmatchscore-blend).

### Every deploy wipes every browser's saved state

`app.js`'s very first top-level statement is `wipeStorageOnNewBuild`: it
compares this build's own stamped `APP_BUILD_ID` (the commit sha
`deploy.yml`'s own sed step stamps into the file on every deploy) against
a marker (`matchfind-app-build-id`) this browser last stored, and on any
mismatch — including a first-ever visit with no marker at all — deletes
*every* `localStorage` key starting with `matchfind-` before anything else
in this file ever reads one. That's every per-viewer preference above,
`matchfind-pinned-choices`, `matchfind-live-sticky-ids`,
`matchfind-day-plan-history`, `matchfind-pregame-scoring`, and
`matchfind-match-snapshot` alike — no per-key exception, deliberately. An
earlier version tagged only the day plan history and match snapshot with
their own copy of `APP_BUILD_ID`, on the theory that real, observed
pre-game scoring (`matchfind-pregame-scoring`) stays true regardless of
what code reads it back and so should survive an update. Direct
instruction reversed that: a scoring/behavior change this app ships (a
reweighted formula, a new bonus) should apply to everything a fresh load
re-fetches, not keep losing to a value an *older* deploy's formula had
already frozen into that cache. Nothing about a day's own stability
depends on that survival either — see "Games that already started are
locked into the day's plan" under [The Viewing Plan
Algorithm](#the-viewing-plan-algorithm): the locking that keeps an
already-started pick from being reshuffled works entirely from *this*
load's own fresh, complete fetch (every day's plan is always built from
that whole calendar day's own complete match list, including any already-
finished game, plus every other fetched day), for the rest of *this* day,
and never actually needed a cache that outlives the deploy that wrote it.

## Live Match Data & Refresh

Every fixture's score is computed fresh, by the viewer's own browser, every
time they open this page and on an ongoing refresh after that — not once,
ahead of time, on a schedule, in a server-side build the way this site used
to work. That whole build-and-redeploy cycle is gone. The browser talks to
exactly one endpoint on the shared proxy, `/sports-proxy` — a thin,
host-allowlisted CORS passthrough to ESPN, the MLB Stats API, Jolpica, and
Polymarket's Gamma API (none of the four sets CORS headers for arbitrary
origins, so a browser can't read any of their responses directly) — never
Gemini or any other AI service.

### Two fetch-and-score refresh tiers

Both tiers below first try the prebuilt snapshot (`refreshFromSnapshot` —
see [Cloudflare Quota](#cloudflare-quota)); only when it isn't current
enough do they run their own live build through the proxy as described
here.

`buildMatches` (`public/lib/match-builder.mjs`) — the same fetch-and-score
pipeline described in [How It Works](#how-it-works) — runs on two refresh
tiers, both through `/sports-proxy`, chosen because ESPN's own scoreboard
endpoint has no multi-day range query for a team sport (confirmed live —
only F1's own `racing/f1` endpoint accepts one), so fetching the whole
14-day window really is one request per league per day, not something a
single cheap query could replace:

- **Near-term** (today + tomorrow, `NEAR_TERM_DAYS_AHEAD`) — cheap, a
  handful of requests, so this runs often (`NEAR_TERM_REFRESH_MS`, every 60
  seconds): new fixtures, scores, and odds for what's actually happening
  soon are the ones worth being genuinely live about.
- **Full window** (the whole 14-day horizon) — expensive (50+ requests),
  so this runs far less often (`FULL_REFRESH_MS`, every 5 minutes): a
  fixture 10 days out doesn't need up-to-the-minute freshness.

Both tiers merge into whatever's already loaded **by id**
(`mergeFreshMatches`) rather than replacing it wholesale — the near-term
tier only ever re-fetches a couple of days, so a wholesale replace would
wipe out every far-future day the last full refresh already populated; and
`buildMatches` itself degrades a single league's own fetch failure to an
empty list for just that league rather than throwing, so replacing the
whole match set with a result where one league came back empty would
delete every match of that league from the page over a single transient
network blip. `mergeFreshMatches` also carries forward each match's own
`.live` detail and live-corrected `durationMinutes` (see [Live Score/Odds
Polling](#live-scoreodds-polling)) rather than letting the fresh,
pre-game-only `buildMatches()` result silently wipe them — an earlier
version didn't, so the live status widget visibly disappeared and
reappeared on every single near-term/full-window tick until the next live
poll (up to 30s later) put it back.

`mergeFreshMatches` also caps how far into the *past* a match is allowed to
linger (`MATCH_RETENTION_PAST_DAYS`, 1 — i.e. 昨天/yesterday, never the day
before that): without this, a match fetched once during a lookback window
(see `fetchTeamLeagueMatches`'s own 2-UTC-day margin, needed to correctly
capture yesterday for a Taiwan viewer from a UTC-anchored query) never got
removed just because a later fetch's own window moved past it — the
upsert-by-id merge only ever adds/overwrites, never deletes — so it sat in
`state.allRawMatches`/the localStorage snapshot indefinitely: both an
unbounded memory grow over a long-lived tab and a real, live-reported bug
(a fixture from two days ago still showing its own day pill, well past this
site's own one-day "yesterday" design). The cutoff is in the viewer's own
local calendar day, the same concept `dayLabelFor`'s 今天/明天/昨天 labels
already use, not UTC.

Before anything has landed (no usable instant-paint snapshot, see
[Instant Paint from a Cached Snapshot](#instant-paint-from-a-cached-snapshot),
and neither the prebuilt snapshot nor a refresh tier has arrived yet, see
[Load Performance](#load-performance)), a `#loading-state` spinner is shown by default rather than leaving the page
blank while `#app`/`#empty-state`/`#error-state` all still say `hidden` —
this was live-reported as confusing before it existed. `applyFreshBuild`,
the one function both snapshot paints and every real refresh funnel
through, hides it the instant either produces something to show; a total
failure with nothing loaded at all swaps it for `#error-state`'s own
explicit message instead.

### Version Detection & Manual Refresh

Settings' **立即重新整理** button just re-runs the full-window tier
immediately, in the viewer's own browser — there's no server-side rebuild
to dispatch and wait 30-60 seconds for anymore; a manual refresh is exactly
as fast as the automatic ones.

**清除資料並重新載入** (Clear Data & Reload), below it, is the escape hatch
for a device stuck on stale state: after a confirm, it clears
localStorage and sessionStorage, unregisters the service worker, deletes
its caches, and reloads from the network with a cache-busting URL (any
query string such as `?debug=taps` is kept) - the next load is exactly
what a first-time visitor gets. Settings, pins and swipes are lost.

It also checks whether a *new version of the page itself* has been
deployed since this tab loaded, not just whether the match data changed
(the same check also runs automatically with every full-window refresh).
Every time, a fresh `cache: 'no-store'` fetch of `app.js` — which the
service worker (see [Load Performance](#load-performance)) always passes
straight to the network — reads back the `APP_BUILD_ID` (the commit sha
`deploy.yml`'s own sed step stamps into it on every deploy) embedded in the
live file's own source, and compares it directly against this tab's own
`APP_BUILD_ID`. An earlier version compared `app.js`'s own ETag/
Last-Modified response header instead, snapshotted once at load — this was
live-reported as never actually hiding the reload button even on the
newest version, since GitHub Pages' CDN can hand back a different ETag for
byte-identical content across separate requests (different edge
node/compression variant), which reads as "changed" when nothing really
did. Comparing the build id embedded in the file's own content instead of
a CDN header has no such false positive — two copies of the same deploy
are byte-identical. A genuine difference reveals a second "發現新版本，點
此重新載入" button — the only way to actually replace a page's own running
JavaScript, which re-fetching match data alone can never do.

That button navigates to a cache-busted URL (`location.pathname + '?_=' +
Date.now()`, via `location.replace`) rather than calling a bare
`location.reload()`. `index.html` itself is served by GitHub Pages with
`cache-control: max-age=600` — a plain reload made within that window can
be satisfied entirely from this browser's own local HTTP cache with no
network request at all. This was live-reported as the reload button still
doing nothing ("never hide") even right after the build-id check above was
already fixed: the check was telling the truth, the click just wasn't
acting on it. A never-before-fetched URL forces a genuine network request
this browser can't answer from disk (GitHub Pages' own CDN was ruled out
separately — it purges/repopulates on every deploy, confirmed live within
seconds of a push, so by the time a viewer would ever click this button
the CDN is already serving the correct content; it was only ever this
browser's own local cache in the way, not the CDN's).

With the service worker in place, one more step comes first. The worker
serves the page and its code from a cache tied to one deploy, and browsers
look for a new worker lazily (iOS home-screen apps especially), so a
reload could otherwise be answered by the *old* worker with the old code
— and the page would find the new version again and reload again, in a
loop. So as soon as a new build id is seen, `prepareServiceWorkerForBuild`
asks for the new worker explicitly and waits (up to 10 seconds) until the
new build's cache (`matchfind-shell-<sha>`) is in place. If it isn't by
then (a failed install, a slow network), the worker is unregistered and its
caches cleared, so the reload comes straight from the network; the next
load registers the new worker from scratch. Either way the reloaded page
is never a mix of two deploys.

### Instant Paint from a Cached Snapshot

Every successful build is cached to `localStorage`
(`matchfind-match-snapshot`) and painted immediately on the *next* page
load, before any network request for that load has even started — the
real refresh tiers still always run right behind it and quietly correct
whatever the snapshot showed, so this is purely a perceived-load-time fix
(a viewer on a slow connection sees last visit's own list instantly instead
of a blank shell), never a substitute for a real fetch. A snapshot older
than `MATCH_SNAPSHOT_MAX_AGE_MS` (30 minutes) is ignored rather than
painted, since a stale-enough copy is more likely to mislead (a
finished-vs-still-scheduled fixture) than to help. It no longer needs its
own per-key deploy tag: `wipeStorageOnNewBuild` (see "Local-Only Data &
Privacy" below) already guarantees a snapshot read back here was written
by the exact build now running, never an older one whose rendering code
assumed a different shape (a renamed field, a newly-required one) — a
viewer who never manually refreshes gets that same guarantee automatically
the next time this tab reloads onto the new deploy, rather than sitting on
a stale, mismatched snapshot indefinitely.

### Efficiency: Caching & Fetch-Skipping

Two layers of caching keep this from being as expensive as it sounds,
since both refresh tiers plus live polling can otherwise add up to several
times the shared proxy's own per-IP rate limit on a single open tab alone:

- **In-tab request cache** (`proxyFetchJson` in `public/app.js`) — every
  `buildMatches()` call's own fetches are cached in memory, per exact
  upstream URL, for `PROXY_FETCH_CACHE_TTL_MS` (45s), with concurrent
  identical requests coalesced into one in-flight call. Near-term and
  full-window's own date ranges overlap heavily (today/tomorrow are
  fetched by both), so without this, every single page load re-fetched
  the same handful of URLs twice, back to back, for no reason. This
  doesn't apply to `pollLiveMatches`'s own faster tier, which always makes
  a fresh request every tick since live score/odds data can't tolerate a
  45s-old cache.
- **Shared edge cache** (`cachePolicyFor` in
  `JayPengX/shared-proxy`'s `sports-proxy-worker.js`) —
  `/sports-proxy` itself caches every successful upstream response, keyed
  by the upstream URL: 20s for scoreboards within a day of today and for
  Polymarket odds (never served once expired, so the 30s live poll always
  gets current scores and odds), but 10 minutes for scoreboards further
  out and 30 minutes for standings, with an expired copy of that slower
  data still served instantly while it refreshes in the background (see
  that repo's README for the full table). So concurrent viewers (and this
  tab's own live-poll tier, which isn't covered by the in-tab cache above)
  share one real upstream fetch instead of each paying for their own; a
  cache hit doesn't count against that route's own rate limit either. On a
  cache miss, that Worker also runs its own rate-limit check (a Workers KV
  read) and the actual upstream fetch *concurrently* rather than one after
  the other — removing a real KV round trip from the critical path of
  every ordinary request.
- **Skips a disabled sport's fetch entirely** — `buildMatches`' own
  `enabledSports` param (Settings' 已啟用的運動 toggles, see [Sport
  Priority & Settings](#sport-priority--settings)) means a league that's
  turned off isn't just filtered out of what's shown; its ESPN/F1 fetch,
  Polymarket odds enrichment, and standings fetch never happen at all on
  either refresh tier — a real reduction in requests-per-refresh (and in
  load on `/sports-proxy` itself) proportional to how many of the 4 sports
  are actually kept on. Turning a sport back on immediately kicks off a
  full-window refresh in the background, so it backfills right away
  instead of waiting for whichever refresh tier happens to fire next.

### Load Performance

What happens between opening the page and seeing the full list, in order:

1. **The code is already on the device.** A service worker
   (`public/sw.js`) keeps `index.html`, `app.js`, the stylesheet, every
   module and the icons in a per-deploy cache (`matchfind-shell-<sha>`;
   `deploy.yml` stamps the sha into `sw.js`, so each deploy installs a new
   worker, which downloads the whole new shell before taking over and then
   deletes the old cache). A cold start — the home-screen app especially,
   which iOS restarts far more often than a Safari tab and which shares no
   cache with Safari — doesn't wait on GitHub Pages at all. Match data,
   odds, logos and fonts are never handled by the worker. How a new deploy
   still gets picked up is in [Version Detection & Manual
   Refresh](#version-detection--manual-refresh). A local checkout (no real
   build id) never registers it.
2. **Without the worker (first visit), nothing waits in line.** `index.html`
   lists every module as `modulepreload`, so all the code downloads in one
   round instead of three nested ones; the Google Fonts stylesheet loads
   without blocking scripts; and connections to the proxy and ESPN's image
   CDN are opened early (`preconnect`).
3. **The first screen comes from a prebuilt snapshot.**
   `.github/workflows/snapshot.yml` runs the same build the page does
   (`scripts/build-snapshot.mjs` — `enrichOdds: false`, then display-only
   Polymarket odds, exactly like `app.js`, so the first screen's
   recommendation agrees with the live build that follows) every 5
   minutes, stamps it with the commit sha as `buildId`, and force-pushes it
   as `matches.json` to this repo's `data` branch (always a single commit).
   GitHub's own `schedule` trigger is too unreliable for a 5-minute
   cadence (a `*/5` cron didn't fire at all for its first 40+ minutes, and
   it routinely runs late or skips), so each run is a loop instead:
   rebuild, wait until 5 minutes after that iteration started, repeat, for
   up to 5h45m. An hourly `schedule` just keeps the next run queued behind
   it (GitHub holds at most one pending run per concurrency group, and
   starts it the moment the loop ends), so a late or skipped cron costs
   nothing. A push to `main` (or a manual run from the Actions tab)
   cancels the running loop and starts a new one immediately, so a new
   deploy gets a snapshot built by its own commit within a minute. A failed
   build just keeps the previous snapshot until the next iteration. `index.html` preloads it from
   `raw.githubusercontent.com` alongside the code — one ~10KB compressed
   request — and `app.js` paints it the moment it arrives, as long as it
   was built by the same deploy as the page and is under 45 minutes old
   (`SERVER_SNAPSHOT_MAX_AGE_MS`), is newer than this browser's own saved
   snapshot, and the live build hasn't already landed. Otherwise it's
   simply ignored and the page waits for its live build as before. Two
   windows where that happens: for a few minutes after each deploy
   (GitHub's CDN caches the file for 5 minutes, so it briefly still serves
   the previous build's snapshot), and if the workflow stops — GitHub
   pauses scheduled workflows in a repo with no commits for 60 days;
   re-enable it from the Actions tab, or just run it once from there (a
   manual run starts a new loop).
4. **A live build through the proxy runs only if the snapshot can't stand
   in for it** — none arrived within 2.5 seconds, or it's more than 12
   minutes old (`SERVER_SNAPSHOT_LIVE_ENOUGH_MS`; see [Cloudflare
   Quota](#cloudflare-quota)). When it does run, to keep it fast:
   Polymarket's `/events` pages are fetched through the proxy's
   `&trim=polymarket-events` mode (only the fields
   `public/lib/polymarket.mjs` reads: 11.5MB → ~0.45MB per MLB page), pages
   2+ are requested in parallel, and that download starts alongside the
   ESPN fetch rather than after the list is painted; standings (fixed
   URLs) are requested alongside the scoreboards instead of after all of
   them come back; up to 12 proxy requests run at once
   (`PROXY_FETCH_MAX_CONCURRENCY`); and most of what's requested is
   already in the proxy's shared cache (see the tiers above).
5. **Logos are in place before the page is shown.** Team/league logos are
   requested through ESPN's own resizer at 64px (`sizedEspnLogoUrl` in
   `public/lib/espn.mjs` — 2-5KB instead of a 20-45KB 500px PNG drawn at
   21px). The Premier League icon is the lion alone: ESPN only has the
   full logo with the "Premier League" wordmark underneath, so the resizer
   also crops it to the top of the image (`LEAGUE_LOGOS` in `app.js`), and
   league icons use `object-fit: cover` to trim the crop's empty sides.
   On the first render, the loading screen stays up as a full-screen
   cover (`.loading-state.is-covering`) over the already-laid-out page and
   only lifts once every image on the page has loaded and decoded
   (`revealApp`), capped at `FIRST_REVEAL_IMAGE_WAIT_MS` (1.5s) so a slow or
   broken image can't hold the page back. Every team's logo in the whole
   window (not just the day shown) plus the league logos start downloading
   as soon as the match list is known (`warmMatchLogos`), and those Image
   objects are kept decoded in memory — stacked cards are rebuilt from
   scratch on every render (their swipe handlers are tied to one render),
   and the held copies let those new `<img>`s paint immediately instead of
   blinking.

`tests/app-shell.test.mjs` keeps the hand-maintained lists involved here
(the worker's `SHELL_FILES`, the `modulepreload` links, and the preloaded
snapshot URL) in sync with the code.

### Cloudflare Quota

Every request through `/sports-proxy` is one Worker request against the
Workers Free plan's **100,000 requests/day for the whole Cloudflare
account** — shared with Orbit's own Worker, and counted even when the
proxy answers from its cache (the Worker still runs to serve it). The
snapshot costs nothing here: GitHub Actions calls ESPN/Polymarket directly
and GitHub serves the file.

Measured on one open tab over 5 minutes:

| Setup | Worker requests | Per hour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Before (every tab built its own data through the proxy; odds polled 48h ahead) | 304 | ~3,600 |
| Now, snapshot available (the normal case), no game live | 0 | 0 |
| Now, snapshot unavailable (fallback) | 199 | ~2,400 |
| Now, during a live game (estimate: ESPN + that sport's Polymarket pages every 30s) | ~70 | ~840 |

How it gets there (`public/app.js`, "Snapshot-first refreshing"):

- **On open**, the page waits up to 2.5s for the snapshot. If it was built
  by the same deploy and is at most 12 minutes old
  (`SERVER_SNAPSHOT_LIVE_ENOUGH_MS`), it *is* the load — no proxy requests.
- **Both refresh timers** (60s and 5 min) re-read the snapshot from
  GitHub, with a per-minute cache-busting query so a newly published one
  shows up within about a minute, and fall back to a proxy build only if
  it isn't current.
- **The 30s live poll** is the one thing that always uses the proxy, and
  only while a game is live or about to start.
- **Refresh now** in Settings still does a full live build through the
  proxy, on purpose.

Fallback happens after a deploy until the snapshot loop has published one
from the new build (usually a minute or two), if GitHub is unreachable, or
if the snapshot workflow has stopped — check the Actions tab if usage
climbs.

### The Shared Proxy Architecture

`public/app.js`'s own `PROXY_URL` constant points at a Cloudflare Worker in
its own dedicated repo,
[JayPengX/shared-proxy](https://github.com/JayPengX/shared-proxy) —
but it's a *different* Worker deployment from the one Orbit/Orbit Vocab's
own AI/sync features use there, not the same URL with a different path.
`/sports-proxy` used to live on that same shared Worker as those two
sites' Gemini-backed features, but that Worker's `[placement]` region pin
(see that repo's own README) is a whole-script setting that was forcing
this route through a pinned Virginia isolate too, adding real,
live-confirmed latency for this site's own Taiwan-based audience with no
benefit (nothing `/sports-proxy` calls has Gemini's region restriction).
It was pulled out into its own separately deployed, unpinned Worker to fix
that — `PROXY_URL` here points at *that* Worker, not `orbit-workers-proxy`.
`/sports-proxy` itself is a plain, host-allowlisted CORS passthrough with
no Gemini involvement. That region-pin issue was a genuine, previously
undiscovered contributor to reports of the first load going blank for 10+
seconds and refreshes taking 10-20+ seconds — confirmed live via an
`X-Worker-Colo: IAD` response header on a plain `/sports-proxy` call before
the split.

Unlike Orbit/Orbit Vocab's own `PROXY_URL` (a GitHub Actions Variable
substituted in at their own build time), Match Find has no build step left
to substitute anything into — its `PROXY_URL` is a plain constant written
directly into `public/app.js`'s own source, pointing at the real deployed
Worker. If you fork this repo and deploy your own shared-proxy Worker,
update that constant to your own Worker's base URL (**no path suffix**);
there's no environment variable to set instead.

### The Gemini Tie-Break: A Removed Experiment

Match Find tried adding a small, bounded Gemini call at the
recommendation-plan level three separate times, and removed it every time.
This is a different thing from the per-fixture scoring AI removal covered
in [Why AI Was Removed From Scoring](#why-ai-was-removed-from-scoring) —
after that removal, the deterministic engine was the sole source of truth
for every fixture's *score*; this later experiment never touched scoring
at all, only which fixture won one day's headline recommendation slot.

1. **First attempt**: a bounded Gemini call (`/match-recommend`, on the
   shared proxy's *other*, `orbit-workers-proxy` Worker) added an
   at-most-once-per-day tie-break for whichever day's headline slot the
   deterministic engine's own top pick had a real alternative for.
2. **Second attempt**: the answer was forced in via `computeDayPlan`'s own
   pin mechanism (the same one a viewer's own swipe-to-pin uses), and
   Google Search grounding was turned on.
3. A real multi-slot selection bug was then fixed, and the mechanism was
   live-tested directly against the deployed Worker — where grounding was
   found hard-blocked by a `429` free-tier quota wall (the same
   `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` signature already hit once before during the
   per-fixture scoring era). Grounding was reverted, a plain call was
   confirmed to work, and that live pick agreed with the deterministic
   engine's own choice rather than the human-validated expectation this
   feature existed to guarantee — proof the mechanism only ever
   guaranteed "whatever Gemini says wins," never "Gemini matches any one
   viewer's taste."
4. Grounding was turned back on after the account moved to paid billing,
   with a hard-enforced origin gate plus a daily global call cap added on
   the Shared-Proxy side specifically because live-testing had just shown
   `/match-recommend`'s URL was callable by anyone who read this repo's
   own public source.

**It was ultimately removed entirely**, per direct instruction: "the
credits it's burning is way beyond its improvement to our system." Every
Gemini-related export
(`selectGeminiTieBreakCandidates`/`buildGeminiTieBreakPayload`/
`resolveGeminiOverridePin`/`computeDayPlanWithGeminiTieBreak`/
`GEMINI_TIE_BREAK_MAX_CANDIDATES`) was deleted from
`public/lib/recommendation.mjs`, `public/app.js` no longer imports or calls
any of them (`renderRecommendedSection` calls `computeDayPlan` directly
again), and the `/match-recommend` route was deleted from Shared-Proxy's
`worker.js` outright.

This also fixed a real, separately-reported UI bug: Gemini's forced pin
reused the exact same `forcedIds`/`.isPreferred` mechanism as a genuine
viewer swipe-pin, so a day whose headline slot got a forced Gemini
override showed 偏好 ("Preferred," the viewer's-own-choice tag) instead of
推薦 ("Recommended," the system's-own-judgment tag) — reported as "every
first game recommended of the day is 'Prefer' rather than 'Recommended'."
With Gemini gone, `forcedIds` is populated only from a real viewer pin
again (`state.pinnedChoices`, written only by `pinSlotChoice`/
`preferMatch`), so this can't recur. (The same class of bug resurfaced
later in the back-to-back variety rotation's own forced picks, and was
fixed the same way — see `clearRotationIsPreferred` in [Back-to-Back
Variety](#back-to-back-variety-whole-window-rotation-among-real-close-contenders).)

Match Find's deterministic engine (`public/lib/recommendation.mjs`) is its
only recommendation logic now — no AI call anywhere, for the second time
in this project's history.

## Live Score/Odds Polling

A third, even faster tier sits on top of the two refresh tiers above —
`pollLiveMatches` (`public/app.js`) polls just score/status/odds for
games that are live, ending, or starting within 15 minutes (an earlier
version also polled odds up to 48 hours before kickoff, which kept it
running around the clock - see [Cloudflare Quota](#cloudflare-quota);
pre-game odds now come from the 5-minute snapshot), on a much shorter interval
(`LIVE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`, 30 seconds) than re-scoring a whole fetch batch
could reasonably run at, by hitting each sport's own narrow live-scoreboard
endpoint (today ± a day, not the whole window) through the same
`/sports-proxy` route and merging the result straight into the same match
objects `buildMatches` already produced — never re-running the
scoring/duration/objective-factor pipeline itself. `init()` also runs this
once immediately on load, rather than letting the first call wait for
`LIVE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` to elapse the way every later recurring tick does —
without that, the live status widgets couldn't appear any sooner than 30
seconds after every single page load, since `match.live` is only ever set
here. Polling is paused while the tab is hidden. Score/status comes from
ESPN's own public scoreboard; odds come from Polymarket instead (see [Live
Win% Odds](#live-win-odds)) — two separate fetches, since not every sport
this tracks has both (F1 has real, live Polymarket odds but no ESPN score
to poll at all).

This never re-runs objective scoring — it only updates the same
`competitors[].score`/`isFinished`/odds fields ESPN/Polymarket already
report, plus two further, real-time-only refinements built from them:

- **`liveExcitementBonus`** (`public/lib/recommendation.mjs`) — a small,
  bounded bonus added to a live match's `planningScore` (never its true
  `effectiveScore`, the same "adjustment, not override" posture as every
  other nudge in this app) from how close its real current score is,
  weighted by how far into the game it already is. A live match that turns
  out to be a genuine nail-biter can win a scheduling slot a pre-game
  prediction alone wouldn't have given it — the whole day's plan is
  recomputed after every live poll that actually changed something, so
  this can visibly reshuffle what's recommended next.
- **`estimateLiveDurationMinutes`** — described in full in [Duration &
  Broadcast-Source Resolution](#duration--broadcast-source-resolution).

Each team row also shows a `.team-score` (`buildTeamRow` in
`public/app.js`) whenever the match is genuinely live/ending-soon or
already finished — never pre-game, where ESPN's own "0" isn't a real score
yet, just the absence of one. This is the actual score; the widgets below
only ever show in-progress *detail* (inning, quarter, lap) around it, never
the score itself.

### Sport-specific live status widgets

Each live poll also writes a `match.live` object with whatever in-progress
detail ESPN reports for that sport, rendered as a small icon-led widget
right under the team names (`buildLiveStatusNode` in `public/app.js`, only
while the card is genuinely live/ending-soon, never pre-game or finished) —
built as real glyphs rather than a flat sentence, since a plain text line
was reported as easy to miss scanning a busy list of cards:

- **MLB**: a small broadcast-style diamond (`.live-diamond`) with a dot at
  each of 1st/2nd/3rd that lights up green exactly when a runner is
  actually on it, next to the inning + half ("第 6 局上/下/中/完") and an
  outs indicator (3 dots, filled as outs accrue) — from ESPN's own
  `competition.situation` object (`extractLiveUpdates` in
  `public/lib/espn.mjs`). The ball-strike count from that same object is
  deliberately *not* shown — it changes on every single pitch (seconds
  apart), so a fixed 30s poll interval almost never catches the current
  count, only a stale one.
- **NBA**: a pulsing live dot plus the quarter ("第 N 節", OT beyond the
  4th) and ESPN's own last-reported game clock — never locally ticked
  between polls, so it correctly holds at the exact recorded time until
  the next update lands rather than counting down on its own.
- **Premier League**: a pulsing live dot plus the half (上半場/下半場) and
  ESPN's own match clock (which already includes stoppage time in its own
  text, e.g. "45'+2'") — or ESPN's own state word (e.g. a halftime label)
  shown as-is when there's no numeric clock to attach it to. Same as NBA,
  this is ESPN's own last-reported value, never locally ticked.
- **F1**: a small colored flag icon (green/yellow/red/safety-car/checkered,
  read from ESPN's own status text, e.g. "Safety Car" or "Checkered Flag" —
  the caution flags flash to catch the eye the way a real broadcast overlay
  would) plus the current lap, from a second extractor
  (`extractF1LiveUpdates`) reading the same `racing/f1` scoreboard
  `match-builder.mjs` already uses for the schedule, this time for its
  per-session `competitors` array (drivers, ordered by ESPN's own live
  classification). The race's current top 3 also renders as its own row of
  medal-colored rank chips (gold/silver/bronze), each with that driver's
  own nationality flag (`athlete.flag` — the one real per-driver icon this
  API actually has; there's no headshot or constructor/team field at all)
  and a gap/interval figure if ESPN ever reports one (checked against
  several real race weekends — `competitor.statistics` came back empty
  every time, so this is read defensively rather than guessed/computed),
  right under the static outright win% chips (see [Live Win%
  Odds](#live-win-odds)) — live running order as context for those odds,
  not a replacement.

### Foreground-return refresh and the "next update" countdown

Every refresh timer above (near-term/full-window/live-poll) reschedules
itself on its own fixed interval even while the tab is hidden — it just
skips the actual fetch each tick. Left alone, a tab backgrounded for
several minutes and brought back gets nothing fresher until whichever
timer next happens to fire, by accident of when it was hidden — this reads
as "the app doesn't notice I came back" even though a refresh was
genuinely overdue. A `visibilitychange` listener
(`handleForegroundReturn`) tracks how long the tab was actually hidden and,
once it's visible again, forces an immediate near-term refresh plus a live
poll right away (plus the full window too, if the tab was away at least
`FULL_REFRESH_MS` itself) — but only once the tab was away longer than
`FOREGROUND_STALE_MS` (30 seconds), so a quick app-switch-and-back doesn't
double up on a refresh that just ran moments ago.

A small `#next-update-note` readout in the footer ticks down every second
to the soonest of the three tiers' own next-scheduled instant (the live
poll only counts while something's actually worth polling, see
`matchWorthPollingNow`), so a viewer watching a live match can see exactly
when its next update is coming rather than only finding out after the
fact.

## Live Win% Odds

Every card that has a real market open for it shows a devigged win%
sourced from Polymarket (`public/lib/polymarket.mjs`) — never a guessed or
defaulted 50/50, hidden entirely when no market exists yet for that
fixture. This was chosen over a sportsbook-odds feed (an earlier version of
this feature used ESPN's own) specifically because a real prediction
market's own trade price already *is* a probability (no American-odds
conversion needed), and it runs a genuine market on every sport this site
tracks, including F1. As of the liquidity-gated scoring integration below,
this is no longer purely a display badge, either — see [Market win%
(Polymarket), replacing the odds spread when it's
liquid](#market-win-polymarket-replacing-the-odds-spread-when-its-liquid)
under [The Deterministic Scoring
Engine](#the-deterministic-scoring-engine) — both the Race (an outright winner market across the
whole grid) and Qualifying (a separate "Driver Pole Position" outright
market, same shape) — shown as the top 3 favorites, not a two-sided bar,
since that wouldn't make sense for a 20-driver field, something no
sportsbook feed here ever covered. MLB/NBA get a single combined
two-outcome market; EPL's own market is a genuine three-outcome one
(home/draw/away), read from three separate binary markets in the same
event and devigged together. Each side of a two-/three-way bar is colored
with that team's own real brand color (`public/lib/color.mjs`'s WCAG
contrast check — falling back to a fixed sport accent only when neither of
a team's two colors reads legibly against the card's current background).

### Sportsbook fallback (ESPN)

Polymarket stays the primary source: its price moves with every trade and
the 30-second live poll picks that up, while a sportsbook line is repriced
by the book, carries its margin, and vanishes from ESPN's scoreboard the
moment a game starts. But ESPN's scoreboard already carries the
sportsbook's (DraftKings') moneyline for game-day fixtures at no extra
request, so `public/lib/sportsbook-odds.mjs` devigs it
(`oddsBookWinPctAway/Home/Draw`) and `resolveDisplayOdds` uses it **before
kickoff only**, when Polymarket has no market for the fixture or one below
`POLYMARKET_MIN_LIQUIDITY_FOR_SCORING`. Once a game starts, the bar is
Polymarket or nothing. A small label under the bar names the source
("Polymarket" or the book's name). The sportsbook numbers are display-only
and never feed the score. Live-checked 2026-09-25: ESPN posts the MLB
moneyline on game day only, and it sat within ~2 points of Polymarket on
every game that day.

F1's own outright markets (Race winner, Pole position) use a different
devig function than the team-sport markets above — `devigPowerMethod`
instead of `devigNWay` — because they're structurally different: MLB/
NBA/EPL each have one single combined market whose own two or three sides
already sum close to 1 on their own (real, tiny vig). F1's outright field
is roughly 23 completely separate, independently-priced Yes/No books, one
per driver, with no shared liquidity forcing them to add up correctly —
live-verified: a real Azerbaijan GP pole-position market's 23 raw "Yes"
prices summed to 4.52, not roughly 1. Naive proportional rescaling (divide
every price by that total) assumes every driver's book carries the same
proportional overround, which is false: a rarely-traded longshot's own
price is inflated far more than a heavily-traded favorite's (a
well-documented prediction-market effect, "favorite-longshot bias") —
live-reported as a leading driver showing an oddly low, flat-looking
percentage (e.g. a real ~45.5% favorite reading as "10%"), indistinguishable
from "no real favorite" even though the market disagreed.
`devigPowerMethod` solves for an exponent `k` such that `sum(p_i^k) = 1`
instead of dividing by the raw total — raising to a power above 1 shrinks a
small price much faster than a large one, so a longshot's own larger excess
gets corrected more than a favorite's smaller one. Percentages still sum to
(near) exactly 100 either way; only how that 100 gets divided up differs.

Polymarket's own Gamma API caps a single request at 100 events regardless
of the `limit` requested, and (a real, live-verified case) MLB alone can
have 170+ currently-open events for its tag at once — not just one event
per game, but a separate event for many games' own player-props/
first-five-winner/inning-9-winner sub-markets too. `fetchAllPolymarketEvents`
pages past that cap, and every request is sorted by the fixture's own real
`startTime` (not `startDate`, which is when Polymarket itself created the
listing) — sorting by listing-creation time had left 50 of 91 real
upcoming MLB fixtures with no odds shown at all, not because no market
existed, but because their event fell outside whichever 100 happened to
sort first by creation time instead of by which game was actually soonest.

                            fixes and design decisions, in chronological order
.github/workflows/deploy.yml
                            publishes public/ to GitHub Pages on every push
                            to main (or on-demand); runs the test suite first
.github/workflows/snapshot.yml
                            long-running loop: every 5 min, builds the
                            first-screen snapshot and publishes it to the
                            `data` branch (restarted on every push to main)
```

The `data` branch holds only `matches.json` (one force-pushed commit,
rewritten every run) — never edit, merge or delete it (it's where the
snapshot lives; if deleted, the loop recreates it within 5 minutes, and
viewers fall back to the proxy until then).

## Getting Started

### Local development

```bash
node scripts/build-data.mjs        # writes a public/data/matches.json snapshot
npx serve public                   # or any static file server
```

A local checkout keeps the literal `__BUILD_ID__` placeholder (only
`deploy.yml` stamps a real one), which switches off the two deploy-only
speedups: the service worker is never registered and the prebuilt snapshot
is never used, so local edits are always what you see.
`node scripts/build-snapshot.mjs [out.json]` builds a snapshot locally if
you want to inspect one.

`scripts/build-data.mjs` is a thin Node CLI wrapper around
`public/lib/match-builder.mjs`'s own `buildMatches` — the exact same
fetch-and-score pipeline the deployed site runs live in the browser, just
callable directly from Node (which can reach ESPN/Polymarket/the MLB Stats
API/Jolpica without going through the shared proxy at all). It's kept
purely for local dev/debugging tooling — the deployed site itself no
longer depends on it or its output. No API key or setup is needed —
`public/lib/objective-score.mjs` and the MLB/F1 API signal fetches
(`public/lib/sport-signals.mjs`) run entirely from free, public, no-key
APIs, and this CLI calls them directly rather than through the shared
proxy.

### Running the test suite

```bash
npm test
```

This runs `node --test` against `tests/*.test.mjs`, with no dependencies to
install. `public/lib/recommendation.mjs` holds every pure scoring/viewing-
plan function (recommendation blending, overlap/slot grouping, weighted
interval scheduling, `computeDayPlan`, `resolveViewingPlan`, confidence),
extracted out of `public/app.js` specifically so it's testable without a
DOM and reusable from `public/lib/match-builder.mjs`. Coverage also
includes `match-builder.mjs`'s own pure ESPN-shape helpers (including
`resolveWhereToWatchTw`/`computeDurationMinutes`/
`computeMatchObjectiveScore`), `sport-duration.mjs`'s own per-sport
duration formulas, `objective-score.mjs`'s own deterministic scoring
formulas, `sport-signals.mjs`'s own pure API-response parsing (hand-built
fixtures shaped like the MLB Stats API's/Jolpica F1 API's own documented
formats, not a live response), `polymarket.mjs`'s own real-market
matching/devig logic, and `color.mjs`'s own WCAG contrast math (both built
from real, live-fetched sample data). The suite also runs as its own step
in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, on every push/dispatch. See
`docs/recommendation-engine-audit.md` for the fuller writeup of what's
covered and why.

### Evaluating a historical export

```bash
node scripts/evaluate-recommendations.mjs <export.json> [more.json ...]
```

Reads one or more `matches.json`-shaped files — a copy saved from
`node scripts/build-data.mjs` or straight from a browser's own devtools
works fine; there is no in-app export button anymore (see [No Developer
Tools in the UI](#no-developer-tools-in-the-ui)) — and reports recommended
count/rate, sport concentration, score/confidence distributions, and how
often the same two teams (or F1 session) get recommended across multiple
distinct dates in the export. This is reported as a descriptive rate, not
flagged as a bug, since a real multi-game series is supposed to do exactly
that in a day-by-day plan (see [The Viewing Plan
Algorithm](#the-viewing-plan-algorithm)). It accepts multiple files so it
can be pointed at a week's worth of separately-saved exports at once
instead of judging one day in isolation.

### Deployment

This repo deploys itself: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` publishes
`public/` to GitHub Pages on every push to `main` (or on-demand via the
Actions tab), stamping the commit sha into `app.js` and `sw.js` as the
build id. The match list is still fetched and scored live, in each
viewer's own browser, on load and on its own refresh tiers (see [Live Match
Data & Refresh](#live-match-data--refresh)) — no deploy is ever needed for
fresh data.

`.github/workflows/snapshot.yml` runs separately, as a long-running loop
that rebuilds every 5 minutes (restarted by every push to `main`, and kept
going by an hourly schedule — see [Load Performance](#load-performance)
for why), and only publishes the prebuilt first-screen snapshot to the
`data` branch; it never deploys the site. In the Actions tab, a run that
shows as "in progress" for hours is that loop working as intended, and
occasional "cancelled" runs are superseded ones. If it stops (a failing upstream API, or GitHub
pausing scheduled workflows after 60 days without commits), the site keeps
working — first loads just wait for the live build again.

Make sure the repo's **Settings → Pages → Source** is set to **GitHub
Actions** (no branch to pick — the workflow handles publishing).

### Icons and link previews

`public/favicon.svg` is the one master mark; `public/icons/icon-180.png`
(apple-touch-icon, e.g. "加入主畫面" on iOS Safari) and `icon-512.png`
(`manifest.webmanifest`) are rasterized from it, and `public/og-image.jpg`
(1200×630) is what a shared link's preview card shows (Messages, Slack,
etc. — see the `og:image`/`twitter:image` tags in `index.html`). All three
PNGs were generated once with headless Chromium screenshotting the SVG at
each size/composition — see the render script referenced in this repo's
commit history if the mark itself ever changes and they need
regenerating; there's no build step that does this automatically.

### Fixing a team's Chinese name

Edit `public/lib/team-names.mjs` — it's a plain object keyed by league id
and ESPN's team abbreviation (e.g. `mlb.NYY`). A missing or wrong entry
doesn't break anything: the site just shows that team's English name only.

## Known Limitations

- **The prebuilt snapshot is skipped for a few minutes after each deploy**
  — GitHub's raw-file CDN caches `matches.json` for 5 minutes, so right
  after a deploy it can still serve the previous build's snapshot, which
  the page ignores (build id mismatch) and falls back to its live build.

- **EPL has no recent-form signal** — ESPN's `soccer/eng.1` standings
  endpoint has no per-team streak/last-5 figure at all (see [Known Scoring
  Limitations](#known-scoring-limitations)).
- **No injury data and no real-time media/narrative signal** in the
  deterministic scoring engine — neither is knowable from the data sources
  this build fetches, and adding either back would mean a new paid data
  source or the per-fixture AI grounding that was tried twice and removed
  both times.
- **F1's per-race modifiers (safety car, weather) aren't modeled** — not
  knowable before a race starts from data this build already has.
- **F1 has no live per-lap timing feed**, so `estimateLiveDurationMinutes`
  always keeps F1's pre-race estimate rather than correcting it live, the
  way MLB/NBA/EPL's durations get corrected in-progress.
- **Ball-strike counts aren't shown live for MLB** — they change on every
  pitch, seconds apart, so a fixed 30-second poll interval would almost
  always show a stale count rather than the current one.
- **F1 gap/interval figures aren't always available** live — ESPN's own
  `competitor.statistics` field has come back empty on every real race
  weekend checked, so it's read defensively rather than relied on.
- **The published `checksums.txt`-style reproducibility concerns from
  this org's other repos don't apply here** — Match Find has no compiled
  build artifact; what's deployed is the same static JavaScript reviewed
  in source.
