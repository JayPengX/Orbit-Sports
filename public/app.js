// ---- public/app.js ----
// Builds and renders the whole match list LIVE, in this browser - calling
// public/lib/match-builder.mjs's own buildMatches directly (through the
// shared proxy, since none of the underlying APIs sends CORS headers - see
// proxyFetchJson below), not by reading a static matches.json a scheduled
// GitHub Action rebuilt and redeployed every 15 minutes the way this used
// to work. That whole build-and-deploy cycle is gone: every viewer's own
// tab now fetches and scores fixtures itself, on load and on two
// recurring refresh tiers (see "Live match data" below) - genuinely live,
// not "as fresh as the last scheduled rebuild happened to be," and a
// manual refresh is now instant (this browser re-fetching and re-scoring
// directly) instead of waiting ~30-60 seconds for a CI build to finish and
// a new static file to deploy.
//
// This file still does everything that has to happen per viewer on top of
// that shared scoring:
//
//   - Converting every UTC kickoff to THIS viewer's own local time.
//   - Deciding which matches form "today's recommended lineup" - this has
//     to run here, not in the shared scoring, because "don't recommend a
//     match starting at 3am" and "which match is closest to right now" are
//     both relative to the viewer's own clock, and buildMatches's own
//     output is the same regardless of which timezone asked for it.
//
// The scoring itself (competitiveness/watchability/reason) is entirely
// deterministic, computed from real sports-data APIs - see
// public/lib/match-builder.mjs's own top comment. There is no AI anywhere
// in this pipeline. `whereToWatchTw` is a hardcoded rule
// (`resolveWhereToWatchTw`, in match-builder.mjs): 愛爾達體育台 for
// everything except an MLB fixture ESPN itself reports as Apple TV. All
// match data comes through the shared proxy's own read-only `/sports-proxy`
// passthrough - used both for building/refreshing the match list (see
// proxyFetchJson) and for live score/odds polling (pollLiveMatches) - plus
// one read of the prebuilt first-screen snapshot from this repo's `data`
// branch (see fetchServerSnapshot). Everything else - sport
// priority, enabled sports, and which swiped match a viewer prefers - is
// local-only, in this browser's own localStorage, with no server-side sync
// of any kind (see README's "Local-only, no accounts").
//
// UI copy goes through ./lib/i18n.mjs's t() (zh-TW by default, English
// auto-detected from the browser - see that module's own top comment); team
// names and venues stay bilingual regardless of UI language (see
// updateTeamRow/renderVenue) since an English team/venue name is often the
// more recognizable half for a fixture nobody has a settled Chinese name
// for yet - that's real sports data, not UI chrome, so it isn't part of the
// i18n layer at all.
//
// The pure scoring/viewing-plan math (overlap/slot/weighted-interval-
// scheduling helpers, computeDayPlan, resolveViewingPlan, confidence, the
// broadcast-service registry) lives in ./lib/recommendation.mjs instead of
// here - extracted so it can be unit-tested directly (see
// tests/recommendation.test.mjs) and reused by public/lib/match-builder.mjs
// (for confidence) without a DOM. The viewer's own local "Prefer" state
// (which swiped match to stick with per slot) is its own further pure
// module, ./lib/preferences.mjs - see that file's own top comment for why
// "match data -> recommendation -> user preference -> UI/card state" are
// kept as four separate layers instead of collapsing into one. This file
// keeps everything DOM/localStorage/render-related, and calls into both
// modules for the rest.

// buildMatches, routing every request through the shared proxy's
// /sports-proxy passthrough instead (see that Worker's own
// SPORTS_PROXY_ALLOWED_HOSTS in shared-proxy's sports-proxy-worker.js - it
// only forwards to hosts it already trusts). Same shape as scripts/build-data.mjs's own Node-side fetchJson,
// just reaching these hosts through the proxy instead of directly.
//
// Cached here, per exact upstream URL, for PROXY_FETCH_CACHE_TTL_MS - this
// is what actually made the initial page load slow, especially on a poor
// connection: refreshNearTerm() and refreshFullWindow() both call
// buildMatches() (see "Live match data" below), and full-window's own date
// range is a strict superset of near-term's - so on every single page load,
// full-window re-requested today/tomorrow's own scoreboard URLs AGAIN,
// seconds after near-term had just fetched the exact same ones, doubling
// the real round-trip count the viewer had to wait through before seeing a
// complete picture. A short TTL (comfortably inside NEAR_TERM_REFRESH_MS,
// so the next scheduled near-term tick still gets a genuinely fresh fetch)
// turns that immediate overlap into a single request, cached in-memory (not
// persisted - there's nothing worth keeping once this tab closes). Also
// coalesces truly CONCURRENT calls for the same URL into one in-flight
// request/response, rather than merely a fast-follow cache read, so two
// refresh tiers that happen to fire in the same tick never both hit the
// network for the same thing. pollLiveMatches's own faster, deliberately
// uncached direct fetches (see that function) are NOT routed through this -
// live score/odds polling needs a guaranteed fresh request every tick, not

// ONE straggler among 50+ simultaneous requests can eat its full timeout,
// and since init() now awaits the WHOLE full-window build before first
// paint (see init()'s own comment), a straggler here no longer just delays
// a quiet background refresh - it directly delays, and can even fail, the
// very first thing the viewer sees. Live-reported directly: "sometimes it
// failed to load also the load time is significantly longer". Gating the
// underlying fetch() calls to a small, fixed number in flight at a time -
// everything past that just queues, FIFO, and gets a slot the instant one
// frees up - keeps every individual request fast and un-contended instead

// ---- Broadcast service registry -------------------------------------------
//
// `whereToWatchTw` is a fixed rule's output (see match-builder.mjs's
// `resolveWhereToWatchTw`), but this registry still matches it by plain text rather than a hardcoded enum
// value here - both service names it can now actually produce (愛爾達體育台/
// Apple TV) already match an entry below, and staying text-matched costs
// nothing while keeping this file decoupled from exactly how the rule
// spells each name. This is what turns that text into something the UI can
// badge/color/reason about consistently, and what OWNED (see
// DEFAULT_MY_SERVICE_IDS below) means at all. Adding a new service
// later is just one more entry here (id, matching pattern, badge/color) -
// nothing else in this file needs to change, same reasoning as
// SPORT_LABEL_KEYS above for sports.
//
// `badge` is a short plain-text mark, not a reproduction of the real
// trademarked logo (this is a static site with no image-licensing story of
// its own) - just enough to be visually recognizable and color-coded at a
// glance, same spirit as the sport badges already on every card.
// `logo` points at each service's real, official mark, hotlinked from an
// external host rather than reproduced/copied into this repo - same
// posture as the team/F1 logos already pulled from ESPN's own CDN
// elsewhere in this file: most are Wikimedia Commons (Special:FilePath,
// its own stable hotlink-friendly redirect to the current file - confirmed
// live, not just assumed), 愛爾達's own is Google Play's app-icon CDN (see
// that entry's own comment for why Commons had nothing usable). `logoBg`
// is the background the mark needs to actually be visible (several of
// these are white- or dark-only artwork with no built-in backdrop) -
// buildMatchCard below tries `logo` first and only falls back to `badge`
// on a load failure (same onerror pattern as team logos) or when `logo`
// is absent.
//
// Deliberately just these three, even though resolveWhereToWatchTw only
// ever actually produces two of them (愛爾達體育台/Apple TV) - kept
// text-matched rather than collapsed to those two exact values so a third
// service (Netflix) already has a ready slot the day this site covers a
// league that airs on it, with nothing else in this file needing to
// change (same reasoning as SPORT_LABEL_KEYS above for sports).
// `logoBg` is a two-stop gradient, not a flat fill (an earlier version used
// a flat fill, which read as a plain colored sticker sitting behind the
// logo rather than a designed icon) - the logo itself stays each service's
// own real, official mark though, hotlinked rather than reproduced into
// this repo, same posture as the team/F1 logos already pulled from ESPN's
// own CDN elsewhere in this file: most are Wikimedia Commons
// (Special:FilePath, its own stable hotlink-friendly redirect to the
// current file - confirmed live, not just assumed), 愛爾達's own is Google
// Play's app-icon CDN (see that entry's own comment for why Commons had
// nothing usable). buildMatchCard tries `logo` first and only falls back
// to the plain colored-initial `badge` on a load failure (same onerror
// pattern as team logos) or when `logo` is absent.
// Fixed rather than a per-viewer Settings toggle (see "Broadcast service
// registry" above) - this site's own owner's real subscriptions, used as a
// silent tie-breaking nudge in resolveViewingPlan only (see
// OWNED_SERVICE_SCORE_BONUS in ./lib/recommendation.mjs) - a great game on a
// service you don't have still shows up and can still be recommended, this
// just tips a genuinely close call. No badge/mark in the UI for it anymore -
// it's a scoring input, not something worth a viewer's attention on every
// card. SERVICES/resolveService themselves now live in ./lib/recommendation.mjs
// (imported above) - this file only still owns which of them are "mine".
// 'netflix' staying in this list is harmless but now permanently inert for
// the score nudge above: since match-builder.mjs's `resolveWhereToWatchTw`
// hardcoded every fixture's `whereToWatchTw` to either 愛爾達體育台 or
// Apple TV (see this repo's README), no fixture can ever match Netflix
// here anymore - kept rather than removed since this constant is still
// meant to describe the owner's real subscriptions, not just which ones
// currently affect scoring.

// ============================================================================
// DO NOT REMOVE - iOS Safari "every tap needs two taps" fix.
// ============================================================================
// Empty, passive, page-wide touch/pointer listeners. They do nothing on
// purpose; their mere EXISTENCE is the fix.
//
// Symptom (iOS Safari and the Home Screen app; desktop Chrome was fine):
// after ONE swipe on a match stack, every later tap on ANY button (day
// tabs, settings, filter chips) needed two taps. It stayed that way until
// the app was swiped away to the background and reopened.
//
// Cause, as best we can tell: iOS WebKit handles a tap differently
// depending on whether the spot being touched has touch/pointer listeners.
// With listeners only on the swipeable cards, a swipe there left WebKit's
// native tap handling stuck in the wrong state, and the next tap anywhere
// without listeners was used up just clearing it. Backgrounding the app
// resets WebKit's gesture state, which is why reopening "fixed" it. With
// listeners on the whole document, every tap goes down the same path, so
// there's nothing to get stuck. Passive, so they never block scrolling.
//
// How it was actually found (after three wrong guesses - see below): the
// hidden tap log (lib/tap-log.mjs, tap "Data last updated" 5 times) made
// the bug disappear whenever it was on. The log's only iOS-relevant side
// effect is registering document-level listeners, so copying just its
// touch/pointer ones here fixed it for good (confirmed on a real iPhone).
//
// What did NOT fix it (all tried first, then removed - don't re-add them
// hoping they help; see git history for the code):
//   1. Explicit releasePointerCapture before the card is removed.
//   2. Deferring choose()'s re-render with setTimeout(0).
//   3. Switching finger swipes from Pointer Events to passive Touch Events.
// None of these could be verified here - Chromium/Playwright never
// reproduces iOS WebKit tap bugs, even with real CDP touch input.
//
// Next time something only breaks on iPhone: turn on the tap log FIRST,
// reproduce, and paste its Copy output (or note if the bug vanishes with
// the log on - that itself narrows it to a listener-registration effect,
// like this one). If this bug ever comes back, try adding the log's other
// document-level listeners here too (mouseover/mousedown/mouseup/click).

// ---- Sport priority settings ---------------------------------------------
//
// The DP in resolveViewingPlan picks whichever match scores highest in each
// overlapping time slot - with MLB's own volume (~15 games most evenings,
// many sharing near-identical start times) split across many similarly-
// scored candidates, and other sports each only fielding one or two
// fixtures at a time, a single MLB game rarely has the single highest score
// in its own crowded slot even when it's a perfectly good one, while a
// less-crowded sport's ordinary fixture more easily comes out on top of
// ITS slot. That's a real structural effect, not a bug to "fix" outright -
// there's no one correct answer for which sport SHOULD win a close call -
// so instead of guessing, this lets each viewer rank the sports in the
// order they'd rather see win a close call, applied only as a tie-breaking
// nudge (see PRIORITY_SCORE_DELTA in ./lib/recommendation.mjs), never a
// hard include/exclude.
// An explicit rank (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...), rather than a per-sport "less/
// normal/more" dial, is the more direct way to ask the actual question:
// "if these two are roughly equally good, which do you want?" - a dial
// still leaves every sport at the same level ambiguous relative to each
// other, where a full order never is.
// ---- One unified recommendation system: "Best Matches" ---------------------
//
// There used to be a viewer-selectable "recommendation style" (話題熱度 vs
// 精彩程度) toggling which per-match score drove 推薦賽事. In practice this
// just split feedback and testing across two subtly different rankings for
// no real benefit - "worth watching" doesn't need two competing answers,
// just one well-reasoned one. resolveViewingPlan (./lib/recommendation.mjs)
// now always uses the single "Best Matches" blend - skill/closeness
// (competitiveness), sustained competitive stakes (enduranceScore), and
// entertainment/public attention (watchability, nudged by broadcastQuality)
// combined, see BEST_MATCH_WEIGHTS there - deliberately never anchored on
// just one of those axes. The viewer's own
// preference is expressed a different way instead: swiping a card stack to
// commit to a specific alternative (see "Prefer" below) - that's the ONE
// place personal taste overrides the algorithm's own judgment, and it's
// local, explicit, and per-match rather than a blanket ranking toggle.

// Every per-viewer localStorage read/write in this file goes through these
// two. Storage can be missing, blocked (private browsing) or full, and the

// ---- Client-side viewing plan -------------------------------------------
//
// Same real-world judgment this site used to run at build time (see git
// history) - moved here because both of its real inputs, "what counts as
// an unreasonable hour" and "what's the closest match right now", are
// relative to THIS viewer's own local clock, which a single build running
// once for every visitor has no way to know. The AI-assigned
// competitiveness/watchability/enduranceScore it works from, on the other
// hand, aren't viewer-relative at all - so those still only ever get
// computed once, at build time.
//
// - QUIET_HOUR_START/END: a match whose LOCAL start falls in this window is
//   never eligible to be recommended, however good its score - nobody
//   asked to be told a 4am fixture is unmissable. It still shows up in the
//   full "all matches" list further down, just never pinned as a pick.
//
// The plan is built ONE LOCAL CALENDAR DAY AT A TIME (computeDayPlan,
// called per selected day from renderRecommendedSection) rather than as
// one pass over the whole 14-day window: "what's worth watching today" is
// inherently a per-day question.
//
// ---- The model: one back-to-back viewing plan, not independent picks ----
//
// You can only actually watch one thing at a time. So 推薦賽事 isn't a set
// of independent "this is good" judgments - it's ONE continuous plan for
// the day: a maximum-total-score chain of matches, none of them truly
// overlapping, that flows from one into the next. Two flawed designs came
// before this: a per-slot "only the best of whatever overlaps wins, chosen
// mostly for AI review, others quality-gated to any interested" - and a
// flat per-match threshold, "clear a fixed score bar and you're
// recommended, independent of everything else" - added right after that
// one to fix the first, then immediately dropping the "one continuous
// plan" idea entirely by not requiring the picks to actually not overlap
// each other at all, so two heavily-overlapping great matches could BOTH
// be "recommended" despite genuinely being impossible to watch both of.
// Direct user feedback on both: the first one silently hid good games,
// the second stopped being an actual PLAN.
//
// This version is a real weighted-interval-scheduling chain: the
// maximum-total-score set of non-overlapping matches for the day, where
// EVERY individual candidate is a scheduling input, never just one
// representative chosen per conflict window ahead of time (see
// computeDayPlan's own comment in recommendation.mjs for why an earlier,
// pre-grouped version of this could silently throw away the globally best
// plan). Two matches that overlap so much you genuinely can't sequence
// them (see isNearTotalOverlap) still only ever end up as one "slot" in
// the final result - a swipeable choice, not two separate picks - but
// that grouping is now a PRESENTATION label computed after scheduling, not
// something that gates what the scheduler itself gets to consider.
// Swiping to a different member PINS it: the plan rebuilds itself around
// that fixed choice, both before and after it (see computeDayPlan).
// enduranceScore feeds directly into how long a pick actually blocks the
// next one from starting (see effectiveDurationMinutes) - a fixture
// unlikely to stay watchable to the end frees up the schedule sooner than
// its full nominal length would suggest. A sport's own duration
// UNCERTAINTY (see SPORT_TIMING/schedulingInterval - MLB has no clock, so
// its 190-minute nominal length is trusted far less than football's or
// F1's) shrinks that block further before it's allowed to hold up
// anything scheduled after it, plus a small fixed transition buffer
// between any two back-to-back picks.

// silently never matches computeDayPlan's own lookup on the next render
// and gets thrown away - see recommendation.mjs's own comment on
// choice.slotKey for the exact 3+-match scenario this bit the user on.
//
// Swiping to whatever the algorithm would ALREADY have picked for this
// slot (naturalSlotChoice, computed with this slot's own pin - if any -
// set aside so it reflects the true unpinned default) clears any existing
// pin instead of setting one, via applySlotSwipe (./lib/preferences.mjs) -
// this is the direct fix for "swiping back changes Recommend into
// Prefer": without it, EVERY swipe recorded a pin, so a card the viewer
// swiped straight back to the algorithm's own default stayed mislabeled
// 偏好 forever instead of reverting to 推薦.
//
// naturalMatchId alone isn't always what actually reappears once a pin is
// cleared, though: variety rotation (computeVarietyRotation/
// mergeVarietyForcedIds) can independently force a DIFFERENT member of
// this exact cluster to win the slot, with no real pin involved at all. If
// the viewer swipes/taps back to naturalMatchId while rotation is forcing
// something else here, there is no pin to clear (rotation was never a real
// pin), applySlotSwipe correctly no-ops, and rotation just re-forces the
// same slot right back on the very next render - live-reported as "can't
// swipe to the first dot, it just reruns to a random place or refuses".
// `unpinnedResultId` is what would ACTUALLY show with no real pin present
// - the rotation-forced id when rotation is forcing this cluster, else the
// plain algorithmic natural pick - so swiping to anything else (including
// naturalMatchId, when rotation is overriding it) correctly becomes a real
// pin instead of a no-op.
//
// That "what would show with no real pin" question has to be asked against
// a version of state.pinnedChoices with THIS slot's own current real pin
// already removed, not just filtered out of the merged result afterward -
// pinnedForDayWithRotation/getVarietyRotation() run computeVarietyRotation
// over the CURRENT state.pinnedChoices, and computeVarietyRotation resolves
// every slot in a day together (Round 44's own "maximum matching", not a
// per-slot decision), so a real pin still sitting in THIS slot can itself
// change what rotation decides to force in a DIFFERENT slot that day.
// Reusing that already-computed rotation here (as an earlier version of
// this function did) meant "this slot's own natural pick" silently
// depended on whatever THIS slot happened to be pinned to a moment ago -
// so swiping out and immediately back could land on a genuinely different
// unpinnedResultId than the one that was true before either swipe, and the
// swipe-back got recorded as a new pin instead of clearing one. Live-
// reported: "swiping then swiping back make recommended label into prefer
// - not always but inconsistently and often" - it only showed up on days
// where some OTHER slot's rotation assignment actually depended on this
// one, which is exactly why it looked random rather than every time.
//
// A pin in a DIFFERENT cluster whose scheduling window still clashes with
// `matchId` (a partial overlap - not near-total, so not a stack-mate) is
// superseded by this choice too: the viewer can't watch both, and leaving
// it pinned both forced the two overlapping games into the plan together
// and kept `matchId` from ever counting as its slot's natural pick.
// Live-reported: "in the full game list, Prefer another game, then Prefer
// the recommended game back - its label goes 偏好, not back to 推薦" - the
// other game's pin was what had displaced it in the first place, so
// dropping that pin is exactly what makes it 推薦 again.

// another. Tapping a control PINS that match immediately (see
// pinSlotChoice/computeDayPlan) - matches before and after it reflow to
// connect with it instead of with whichever match was the plan's own
// default pick.
//
// Deliberately NOT a drag/swipe gesture - see this function's own git
// history for the two designs this replaced (native scroll-snap polling for
// momentum to settle, then a hand-rolled Touch-Events drag with a CSS
// transform) and the string of real, live-reported regressions BOTH kept
// producing on real Safari: stuck cards, a stack frozen solid after a
// single swipe, cards landing on the wrong index. Every one of those bugs
// came from the same root cause - inferring "the gesture is done, it is now
// safe to commit and reparent this DOM node" from some signal (a poll, a
// frame count, a transitionend event) that real WebKit didn't reliably
// deliver when this codebase needed it to. A tap has no such problem: a
// `click` handler fires exactly once, synchronously, with nothing further
// to wait for - there is no gesture-in-progress state this node can get
// stuck in, because there is no gesture, only a discrete press. This also
// means every render can simply show whichever member is currently primary,
// with no separate DOM-node-reuse mechanism needed to avoid a visible
// flash (see this file's own git history for the old interactedStack/
// patchStackSelectionTags machinery that existed only to work around that)
// - and no scroll position or open touch sequence than can ever survive
// (or fail to survive) a render pass, so this is also the direct fix for
// "one swipe reused an old stale visual state forever" (a `.is-muted` class
// that patchStackSelectionTags never got around to clearing being the
// concrete case reported).
// Tracks whether a card is currently mid-drag, ACROSS every rendered stack
// (a plain counter, not a single boolean, since it's shared module state
// and simplest to just never go negative rather than assume only one
// stack can ever be dragged at a time). renderSections (below) defers
// itself while this is nonzero instead of tearing the DOM out from under
// an active gesture - see that function's own comment for the two real,
// reported bugs this fixes: a team-logo flash on every background-
// triggered re-render (a routine live-data poll arriving mid-interaction)
// and a swipe silently breaking
// mid-drag (the dragged card's own DOM node, and its pointer capture, gets

  // docs/recommendation-engine-audit.md Round 12):
  //   - The commit decision happens synchronously in pointerup, from the
  //     pointer's final position - never in a requestAnimationFrame or
  //     transitionend callback, which Safari can silently never fire (an
  //     earlier version got stuck after one swipe that way).
  //   - Pointer Events + setPointerCapture, so a finger or cursor drifting
  //     outside the card mid-drag doesn't lose the gesture.
  //   - `touch-action: pan-y` (styles.css) lets the browser itself decide
  //     "vertical page scroll" vs. "horizontal swipe".
  //   - On a commit, card.style is left untouched before choose() removes the
  //     card. Writing any transform to it in that same tick left a "ghost"
  //     of the swiped card stuck on screen on iPad Safari.
  //   - pointerup, pointercancel and lostpointercapture all end the drag, so
  //     the card can never be stranded mid-transform.

// a tab open for days could sit on stale logic indefinitely with no signal
// anything had changed.
//
// An earlier version of this compared app.js's own ETag/Last-Modified
// response header, snapshotted once at load - live-reported as "發現新
// 版本，點此重新載入 never hide despite already in the newest version",
// i.e. the comparison kept saying "different" when it genuinely wasn't.

// byte-identical content depending on which edge node/compression variant
// actually answered a given request, which is exactly a false "new
// version" waiting to happen on every single check.

// real deploy). This tab already knows its OWN build id trivially (it's a
// plain constant in this very file) - no "snapshot a baseline at load"
// step is even needed anymore, just fetch the live app.js's own source and

// service worker, no app-store update prompt - see this file's own top
// comment). Live-reported directly: wanting the app to "always keep itself
// up to date" rather than relying on that manual tap.
//
// No timer of its own - wired straight into refreshFullWindow below (the
// existing full-window data grab, already running every FULL_REFRESH_MS in
// the background, on top of once at init() and once on any stale foreground
// return), so a version check just rides along with a fetch that was
// happening anyway rather than this file needing to track yet another
// independent schedule. The moment a new deploy is found, this reloads
// automatically - but only while nobody is actually looking at the tab, the
// same way every other background refresh tier here already defers
// disruptive work rather than yanking an active viewer off whatever they're
// doing (mid-swipe, mid-read). A tab that's already hidden at check time
// reloads immediately (nothing to interrupt); a tab that's visible just
// gets an unobtrusive note in Settings, applied automatically the moment
